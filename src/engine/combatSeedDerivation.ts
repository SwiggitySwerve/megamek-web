/**
 * Combat-seed derivation for session producers that build bare `IGameUnit`
 * lists (catalog `unitRef` + pilot skills only) instead of holding adapted
 * units the way the `InteractiveSession` constructor does.
 *
 * Per `extend-combat-seed-to-all-session-producers` (game-session-management
 * "Combat State Seeding at Session Creation"): every production session
 * producer SHALL supply per-location armor/structure/heat-sink construction
 * inputs on the units it passes to `createGameSession`. PR #998 wired the
 * splice into `InteractiveSession` and `GameEngine.runToCompletion` only;
 * the encounter-launch, lobby, and pre-battle builders bypassed it and kept
 * producing 0-armor sessions.
 *
 * Lives in the engine (not `utils/gameplay`) because the derivation needs
 * the catalog adapter, and `utils/gameplay` importing the engine would
 * create an import cycle — the engine already imports `utils/gameplay`
 * heavily. Producers outside `utils/gameplay` (services, pages-modules,
 * hooks) import from here directly; `utils/gameplay` builders stay pure and
 * are seeded by their callers through these wrappers.
