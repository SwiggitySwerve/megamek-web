/**
 * The host GM's rewind controls on the networked lobby surface
 * (umbrella 19.3).
 *
 * REPLACES the two inert stubs as the host GM's control on the production
 * lobby route. `networked-gm-preview-btn` / `networked-gm-approve-btn`
 * called props that defaulted to no-ops, so on the lobby route - which
 * passes neither - pressing them did nothing and nothing said so, and the
 * GM's conclusion from pressing one is "the correction went through"
 * (defect #15). The defaults are gone, so that block now renders only for
 * the `/e2e/networked-command-proof` harness that actually wires it, and
 * this is what the host sees in production.
 *
 * REPLACED-WHEN-EMITTED - the preview producer is injected rather than
 * fetched here. The route that will answer, `POST
 * /api/matches/[id]/rewind-preview`, is task 3b-iii and does not exist on
 * any branch yet. Its contract is already fixed: the
 * `GmCombatRewindPreviewResult` union VERBATIM as the body (200 for a
 * preview, 403 / 404 / 409 for refusals), while a transport failure (400,
 * 401, 405, 500) answers `{ error, reason? }` with NO `kind` field. So the
 * adapter that lands with the page wiring branches on the presence of
 * `kind`; anything else - including a thrown fetch - reaches this component
 * as `unavailable`, which is phrased on its own and never shows what threw.
 *
 * Until a page passes a producer, the preview control renders DISABLED
 * with the reason, and the confirm arm is disabled until a commit
 * producer is passed beside it.
 *
