/**
 * Campaign share panel (task 2.2).
 *
 * Lets the owner of a campaign hand out scoped access, see who currently
 * holds it, and withdraw it.
 *
 * Two presentation decisions carry weight:
 *
 * - Revoked grants stay listed, visibly marked. Dropping them would
 *   leave the owner unable to tell "never shared with them" from
 *   "shared and later withdrawn", which is exactly the question you ask
 *   when auditing access.
 * - A replica renders NO share controls at all. A replica holds someone
 *   else's campaign under a grant that may be narrower than what it
 *   would hand on; the server refuses such a request anyway, but showing
 *   a control that always fails is its own kind of lie.
 *
 * Presentational: the caller owns fetching and mutation, so this panel
 * can be exercised without a live server.
 *
 * @spec openspec/changes/design-campaign-authority-and-sync/specs/campaign-replication/spec.md
