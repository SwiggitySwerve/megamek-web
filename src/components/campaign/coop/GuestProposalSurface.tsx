/**
 * GuestProposalSurface — the guest-facing campaign-action surface (CO2).
 *
 * A guest in a shared co-op campaign does NOT mutate campaign state — a
 * guest campaign action is an `IGuestProposal` the GM arbitrates
 * (design D4). This surface presents the guest's campaign controls
 * (hire pilot / accept contract / spend) as PROPOSAL controls:
 *
 *   - submitting a control raises a proposal and shows a PENDING
 *     indicator on that action; a duplicate submit of the same action
 *     is disabled while it is unresolved (spec "Guest Proposal Feedback
 *     Surface");
 *   - on resolution the surface shows whether the proposal committed a
 *     campaign event, was vetoed by the GM, or failed mechanical
 *     validation — a GM veto reads visually distinct from an impossible
 *     action (spec scenario "Veto is distinct from a mechanical
 *     rejection").
 *
 * The surface is presentational — the proposal lifecycle is owned by
 * the `useGuestProposals` hook the caller supplies. It introduces no
 * transport (design D7).
 *
 * @spec openspec/changes/add-coop-campaign-play/specs/coop-campaign-sync/spec.md
