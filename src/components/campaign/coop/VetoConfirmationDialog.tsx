/**
 * Confirmation for the GM's veto (umbrella 19.3).
 *
 * Veto is the destructive authority action on the review surface: it
 * rejects another player's proposal, and unlike Preview / Manual / GM Fix
 * it is genuinely wired to a transport. So it asks first.
 *
 * WHY NOT `DialogTemplate`. The shipped modal stack (ModalOverlay ->
 * DialogTemplate) supplies the overlay, the Escape handler and a focus
 * trap, and it would have been the obvious base. Two things stopped it.
 * It puts `aria-labelledby` on the CONTENT div rather than on the element
 * carrying `role="dialog"`, so the dialog has no accessible name - a
 * screen reader announces "dialog" and nothing else. And it never
 * restores focus on close, which drops a keyboard user on <body>. Both
 * are real defects in shared UI with fifteen consumers; fixing them there
 * is the correct fix but not this seam's, so this dialog is built here
 * and the gaps are recorded rather than inherited silently.
 *
 * The focus trap itself is NOT re-implemented: `trapFocus` already exists
 * in `src/utils/accessibility.ts`. ModalOverlay duplicates it inline; a
 * third copy is how the three drift apart.
