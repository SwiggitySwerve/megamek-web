/**
 * HostGmReviewSurface — the host-facing GM review surface (CO2).
 *
 * In `host-review` GM arbitration mode every guest proposal that passes
 * CO1 mechanical validation is surfaced to the host, who explicitly
 * issues `approve` or `veto` (design D5). This surface lists the
 * pending proposals with the campaign context the host needs to decide:
 *
 *   - the current C-bill balance,
 *   - the relevant faction standing (for an `AcceptContract`),
 *   - the proposal's roster/ledger effect summary.
 *
 * (spec "Host GM Review Surface".)
 *
 * The surface is presentational — the pending queue is owned by the
 * `CampaignGmArbiter`. `approve` / `veto` clicks are forwarded to the
 * caller-supplied `onDecide` callback, which wires them to
 * `CampaignGmArbiter.decide`. The surface introduces no transport
 * (design D7).
 *
 * @spec openspec/changes/add-coop-campaign-play/specs/coop-campaign-sync/spec.md
