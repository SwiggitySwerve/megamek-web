## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Critical Business Logic (Immediate)

The following areas contain critical BattleTech construction rules and should have comprehensive tests:

1. **services/units/** - Unit management services at 41.5% coverage
   - Focus on: UnitLoaderService, UnitNameValidator, CustomUnitApiService
   
2. **services/persistence/** - Data persistence at 17.4% coverage
   - Focus on: FileService, MigrationService, IndexedDBService

3. **utils/construction/** - Construction calculations at 83.4% coverage
   - Generally well-tested, but verify movementCalculations.ts

### Priority 2: User Interface (Short-term)

4. **components/customizer/** - Main editor UI at 0% coverage
   - These are React components but critical for the user experience
   - Add integration tests for key user flows

5. **utils/colors/** - Color utilities at 0% coverage
   - Simple utilities, easy wins for coverage

### Priority 3: API Endpoints (Medium-term)

6. **pages/api/units/** - Unit API at 11.1% coverage
   - Custom unit CRUD operations need testing

## Coverage Targets

Based on the current state, recommended coverage thresholds:

```javascript
// jest.config.js
coverageThreshold: {
  global: {
    statements: 50,
    branches: 40,
    functions: 45,
    lines: 50
  },
  './src/services/construction/': {
    statements: 80,
    branches: 60,
    functions: 90
  },
  './src/utils/construction/': {
    statements: 90,
    branches: 70,
    functions: 95
  },
  './src/utils/validation/': {
    statements: 95,
    branches: 85,
    functions: 100
  }
}
```

---

## Test File Mapping

Current test files exist in `src/__tests__/` with the following structure:
- `api/` - API endpoint tests
- `components/` - React component tests
- `hooks/` - Custom hook tests
- `integration/` - Integration tests
- `service/` - Service layer tests
- `stores/` - Zustand store tests
- `unit/` - Unit tests for utilities

---

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm run test:coverage` to generate fresh coverage data
2. Open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in browser for detailed view
3. Focus on Priority 1 items first
4. Add coverage thresholds to prevent regression
5. Set up CI to track coverage trends
