## Overview

### Purpose
Defines the engine subsystem for BattleMech units, including engine types, rating system, weight and critical slot calculations, and critical slot placement rules across center and side torsos. The engine is the heart of a BattleMech, determining movement capability, heat dissipation capacity, and occupying critical internal structure.

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Engine type definitions (Fusion, XL, XXL, Light, Compact, ICE, Fuel Cell, Fission)
- Engine rating system (10-500 in multiples of 5)
- Weight calculation formulas per engine type
- Critical slot count formulas per engine type
- Exact critical slot placement rules (CT and side torso locations)
- Integral heat sink capacity
- Movement calculation relationship (rating / tonnage = walk MP)
- Tech base variants (IS vs Clan differences)
- Rules level classification per engine type

**Out of Scope:**
- Movement point calculation details (covered in Movement System spec)
- Heat sink system implementation (covered in Heat Management spec)
- Engine damage and critical hits (covered in Damage System spec)
- Engine cost and Battle Value formulas (covered in Economics System spec)
- Specific engine availability by era (covered in Component Database spec)

### Key Concepts
- **Engine Rating**: Numeric value (10-500) determining movement capacity and engine weight
- **Engine Type**: Classification affecting weight, slots, and tech requirements
- **Critical Slots**: Engine occupies CT (center torso) and potentially side torso locations
- **Integral Heat Sinks**: Free heat sinks included within engine rating
- **Walk MP**: Movement points = rating / mech tonnage (rounded down)
- **XL Technology**: Extra-Light engines trade protection for weight savings
- **Side Torso Slots**: XL/XXL engines extend into left and right torso critical slots

**Rationale**: Engine rating determines movement, weight, and slot requirements. Ratings follow specific increments.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Valid engine rating
**GIVEN** a mech configuration is being created
**WHEN** selecting engine rating
**THEN** rating MUST be between 10 and 500
**AND** rating MUST be a multiple of 5
**AND** rating SHALL be immutable once set

**AND** system SHALL reject ratings above 500
**AND** error message SHALL indicate valid rating range

#### Scenario: Movement calculation
**GIVEN** engine rating and mech tonnage
**WHEN** calculating walk MP
**THEN** walk MP = rating / tonnage (rounded down)
**AND** run MP = walk MP × 1.5 (rounded down)
**AND** minimum walk MP SHALL be 1 (rating >= tonnage)

#### Scenario: Rating too low for tonnage
**GIVEN** engine rating 100 and mech tonnage 100
**WHEN** calculating movement
**THEN** walk MP = 1
**AND** system MAY warn if walk MP < 2 (severely underpowered)

### Requirement: Engine Weight Calculation
The system SHALL calculate engine weight based on rating and engine type using official formulas.

**Rationale**: Engine weight is critical for mech construction and follows precise weight tables.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Standard Fusion weight
**GIVEN** Standard Fusion engine with rating R
**WHEN** calculating weight
**THEN** weight = (R / 100)² × 5 tons (rounded to nearest 0.5 ton)
**AND** minimum weight = 0.5 tons

#### Scenario: XL Engine weight
**GIVEN** XL engine (IS or Clan) with rating R
**WHEN** calculating weight

#### Scenario: Fission Engine weight
**GIVEN** Fission engine with rating R
**WHEN** calculating weight
**THEN** weight = Standard Fusion weight × 1.5
**AND** additional shielding weight may apply

### Requirement: Critical Slot Calculation
The system SHALL calculate center torso critical slots based on engine rating and type.

**Rationale**: Engine slot count varies by rating. Larger engines occupy more internal structure.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Standard engine CT slots
**GIVEN** Standard Fusion, ICE, or Fuel Cell engine with rating R
**WHEN** calculating CT slots
**THEN** slots = formula based on rating brackets:
- Rating 100 or less: 3 slots
- Rating 105-150: 4 slots
- Rating 155-225: 5 slots
- Rating 230-325: 6 slots
- Rating 330-400: 7 slots
- Rating 405-500: 8 slots

#### Scenario: Compact engine CT slots
**GIVEN** Compact engine with rating R
**WHEN** calculating CT slots
**THEN** slots = (R / 25) rounded up, minimum 2
**AND** slots SHALL be less than standard engine slots

#### Scenario: XL/XXL/Light engine CT slots
**GIVEN** XL, XXL, or Light engine with rating R
**WHEN** calculating CT slots
**THEN** CT slots = same as Standard Fusion engine for that rating
**AND** additional side torso slots apply separately

### Requirement: Critical Slot Placement
The system SHALL place engine critical slots in specific locations with exact slot indices.

**Rationale**: Engine placement follows strict rules. CT slots fill first, then side torsos for XL-type engines.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Standard engine placement
**GIVEN** Standard Fusion engine requiring N slots
**WHEN** placing engine in mech
**THEN** occupy CT slots 1 through N (starting from top)
**AND** CT has 12 total slots
**AND** remaining slots available for equipment/gyro

#### Scenario: XL Engine (IS) placement
**GIVEN** XL (Inner Sphere) engine requiring N CT slots
**WHEN** placing engine in mech
**THEN** occupy CT slots 1 through N
**AND** occupy LT (Left Torso) slots 1-3
**AND** occupy RT (Right Torso) slots 1-3
**AND** total engine slots = N + 6

#### Scenario: XL Engine (Clan) placement
**GIVEN** XL (Clan) engine requiring N CT slots
**WHEN** placing engine in mech
**THEN** occupy CT slots 1 through N
**AND** occupy LT (Left Torso) slots 1-2
**AND** occupy RT (Right Torso) slots 1-2
**AND** total engine slots = N + 4

**AND** occupy LT (Left Torso) slots 1-2
**AND** occupy RT (Right Torso) slots 1-2
**AND** total engine slots = N + 4

#### Scenario: XXL Engine placement
**GIVEN** XXL engine requiring N CT slots
**WHEN** placing engine in mech
**THEN** occupy CT slots 1 through N
**AND** occupy LT (Left Torso) slots 1-3
**AND** occupy RT (Right Torso) slots 1-3
**AND** total engine slots = N + 6

#### Scenario: Compact Engine placement
**GIVEN** Compact engine requiring N slots (reduced)
**WHEN** placing engine in mech
**THEN** occupy CT slots 1 through N
**AND** occupy no side torso slots
**AND** more CT slots available for other equipment

#### Scenario: Engine slot validation
**GIVEN** engine is being placed
**WHEN** validating slot allocation
**THEN** engine slots MUST NOT overlap with structure/gyro
**AND** side torso slots MUST be first 2-3 slots from top
**AND** engine slots MUST be contiguous within each location

### Requirement: Integral Heat Sinks
The system SHALL calculate integral heat sink capacity based on engine rating.

**Rationale**: Engines include free heat sinks up to rating/25. Additional heat sinks must be installed separately.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Integral heat sink count
**GIVEN** engine with rating R
**WHEN** calculating integral heat sinks
**THEN** integral count = min(10, R / 25 rounded down)
**AND** integral heat sinks occupy no additional critical slots
**AND** integral heat sinks add no weight beyond engine weight

#### Scenario: Small engine heat sinks
**GIVEN** engine with rating 100
**WHEN** calculating integral heat sinks
**THEN** integral count = 4 (100 / 25)
**AND** mech requires 6 additional heat sinks to reach minimum 10
**AND** additional heat sinks occupy slots and add weight

#### Scenario: Large engine heat sinks
**GIVEN** engine with rating 250 or higher
**WHEN** calculating integral heat sinks
**THEN** integral count = 10 (capped at 10)
**AND** all 10 mandatory heat sinks are integral
**AND** no heat sink slots required for base 10

#### Scenario: Double heat sink integration
**GIVEN** engine with integral capacity and double heat sinks
**WHEN** installing heat sink system
**THEN** integral doubles occupy same 0 slots and 0 weight
**AND** dissipation = integral count × 2
**AND** additional doubles require 3 slots and weight each

### Requirement: Tech Base Variants
The system SHALL enforce tech base restrictions per engine type.

**Rationale**: Some engine types are exclusive to IS or Clan. Others have tech base variants with different stats.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: IS-only engine types
**GIVEN** Light Engine or Compact Engine
**WHEN** validating tech base
**THEN** techBase MUST be TechBase.INNER_SPHERE
**AND** Clan mechs CANNOT use these engines
**AND** validation error if tech base mismatch

#### Scenario: Clan-only engine types
**GIVEN** no Clan-exclusive engines currently
**WHEN** validating tech base
**THEN** all fusion types available to Clan
**AND** Clan may use Clan XL variant

#### Scenario: Universal engine types
**GIVEN** Standard Fusion, XXL, or ICE engine
**WHEN** validating tech base
**THEN** engine MAY be TechBase.INNER_SPHERE
**OR** engine MAY be TechBase.CLAN
**AND** stats are identical between tech bases

#### Scenario: XL Engine tech variant
**GIVEN** XL Engine selection
**WHEN** tech base is Inner Sphere
**THEN** use XL (IS) variant with 3 side torso slots
**WHEN** tech base is Clan
**THEN** use XL (Clan) variant with 2 side torso slots
**AND** weight is identical between variants

#### Scenario: Mixed tech mech engine
**GIVEN** mech with Mixed tech base
**WHEN** selecting engine
**THEN** engine tech base determines variant used
**AND** IS engine in mixed mech uses IS rules
**AND** Clan engine in mixed mech uses Clan rules

### Requirement: Rules Level Classification
The system SHALL classify engines by rules rules level.

**Rationale**: Engine availability varies by campaign rules complexity.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Introductory engines
**GIVEN** Standard Fusion or ICE engine
**WHEN** filtering by rules level
**THEN** available at RulesLevel.INTRODUCTORY
**AND** available at all higher rules levels

#### Scenario: Standard rules engines
**GIVEN** XL (Clan) engine
**WHEN** filtering by rules level
**THEN** available at RulesLevel.STANDARD
**AND** available at Advanced and Experimental
**AND** NOT available at Introductory

#### Scenario: Advanced rules engines
**GIVEN** XL (IS), Light, Compact, or Fuel Cell engine
**WHEN** filtering by rules level
**THEN** available at RulesLevel.ADVANCED
**AND** available at Experimental
**AND** NOT available at Introductory or Standard

#### Scenario: Experimental engines
**GIVEN** XXL or Fission engine
**WHEN** filtering by rules level
**THEN** available ONLY at RulesLevel.EXPERIMENTAL
**AND** NOT available at any lower rules level
**AND** may have unstable or untested characteristics

## Calculation Formulas

### Engine Weight Formula

**Formula**:
```
Standard Fusion Weight (SFW):
  SFW = ((rating / 100)²) × 5 tons
  Round to nearest 0.5 ton

Engine Type Multipliers:
  Standard Fusion:  SFW × 1.0
  XL (IS/Clan):     SFW × 0.5
  XXL:              SFW × 0.333
  Light:            SFW × 0.75
  Compact:          SFW × 1.5
  ICE:              ((rating / 100)²) × 2 tons
  Fuel Cell:        SFW × 1.2
  Fission:          SFW × 1.5
```

**Where**:
- `rating` = Engine rating (10-500)
- `SFW` = Standard Fusion Weight baseline

**Example**:
```
Input: rating = 300, engineType = XL_CLAN
Calculation:
  SFW = ((300 / 100)²) × 5 = 9² × 5 = 45 tons
  XL Weight = 45 × 0.5 = 22.5 tons
Output: weight = 22.5 tons
```

**Special Cases**:
- When rating < 100: Weight may be less than 5 tons
- When weight calculation yields X.25 or X.75: Round to nearest 0.5 (down for .25, up for .75)
- ICE engines use separate base formula (× 2 instead of × 5)

**Rounding Rules**:
- Always round to nearest 0.5 ton
- Examples: 22.3 → 22.5, 22.7 → 22.5, 22.8 → 23.0

### Center Torso Slots Formula

**Formula**:
```
For Standard, XL, XXL, Light, ICE, Fuel Cell, Fission:
  if rating <= 100:       3 slots
  else if rating <= 150:  4 slots
  else if rating <= 225:  5 slots
  else if rating <= 325:  6 slots
  else if rating <= 400:  7 slots
  else:                   8 slots

For Compact:
  slots = ceiling(rating / 25)
  minimum 2 slots
```

**Where**:
- `rating` = Engine rating

**Example**:
```
Input: rating = 300, engineType = STANDARD
Calculation: rating <= 325, so 6 slots
Output: centerTorso = 6

Input: rating = 250, engineType = COMPACT
Calculation: ceiling(250 / 25) = 10 slots
Output: centerTorso = 10 (but this is invalid, Compact saves slots not adds them)
Note: Correct Compact formula is different - see Implementation Notes
```

**Special Cases**:
- Compact engine: Uses (rating / 25) rounded up, minimum 2
- All other engines use rating bracket table

### Side Torso Slots Formula

**Formula**:
```
Standard, Compact, ICE, Fuel Cell, Fission:
  leftTorso = 0
  rightTorso = 0

XL (Inner Sphere), XXL:
  leftTorso = 3
  rightTorso = 3

XL (Clan), Light:
  leftTorso = 2
  rightTorso = 2
```

**Where**:
- Engine type determines side torso slot allocation

**Example**:
```
Input: engineType = XL_INNER_SPHERE
Output: leftTorso = 3, rightTorso = 3

Input: engineType = LIGHT
Output: leftTorso = 2, rightTorso = 2
```

### Integral Heat Sinks Formula

**Formula**:
```
integralHeatSinks = min(10, floor(rating / 25))
```

**Where**:
- `rating` = Engine rating
- `floor()` = Round down to integer
- `min()` = Take smaller of two values

**Example**:
```
Input: rating = 100
Calculation: floor(100 / 25) = 4, min(10, 4) = 4
Output: integralHeatSinks = 4

Input: rating = 300
Calculation: floor(300 / 25) = 12, min(10, 12) = 10
Output: integralHeatSinks = 10
```

**Special Cases**:
- Rating 250+: Always 10 integral heat sinks
- Rating < 25: 0 integral heat sinks (very rare)

### Movement Points Formula

**Formula**:
```
walkMP = floor(rating / tonnage)
runMP = floor(walkMP × 1.5)
```

**Where**:
- `rating` = Engine rating
- `tonnage` = Mech tonnage
- `floor()` = Round down to integer

**Example**:
```
Input: rating = 300, tonnage = 75
Calculation:
  walkMP = floor(300 / 75) = floor(4) = 4
  runMP = floor(4 × 1.5) = floor(6) = 6
Output: walk = 4, run = 6

Input: rating = 300, tonnage = 100
Calculation:
  walkMP = floor(300 / 100) = floor(3) = 3
  runMP = floor(3 × 1.5) = floor(4.5) = 4
Output: walk = 3, run = 4
```

**Special Cases**:
- walkMP minimum is 1 (rating >= tonnage)
- walkMP = 0 is invalid (engine too weak for mech)

**Rounding Rules**:
- Always round down (floor function)
- No fractional movement points

## Tech Base Variants

See [Tech Base Variants Reference](../tech-base-variants-reference/spec.md) for general Inner Sphere vs Clan differences, the "3-2 Pattern" for slot differences, and philosophy behind tech base variations.

### Engine-Specific Tech Base Differences

**XL Engine Side Torso Slots**:
- Inner Sphere XL: 3 slots per side torso (6 total side slots)
- Clan XL: 2 slots per side torso (4 total side slots)
- Weight: Identical (50% of standard fusion)
- Center Torso: Identical (rating-dependent, 3-8 slots)

**Inner Sphere-Exclusive Engine Types**:
- Light Engine: 75% weight, 2 slots per side torso
- Compact Engine: 150% weight, fewer CT slots (rating/25 rounded up)
- Both NOT available to Clan tech base

**Clan Engine Characteristics**:
- More compact XL implementation (2 vs 3 side slots)
- XL available at Standard rules level (vs IS Advanced)
- No Light or Compact variants (different technological path)

**Mixed Tech Application**:
- Mixed tech units may use IS Light Engine (uses IS slot pattern)
- Mixed tech units may use Clan XL Engine (uses Clan slot pattern: 2 side slots)
- Cannot mix XL variants in same unit
- Engine tech base must be explicitly declared

**Example - Slot Difference**:
```typescript
// Inner Sphere XL Engine
const isXL: IEngine = {
  // ... other properties
  criticalSlots: {
    centerTorso: 6,
    leftTorso: 3,    // IS: 3 slots
    rightTorso: 3,   // IS: 3 slots
  },
};

// Clan XL Engine
const clanXL: IEngine = {
  // ... other properties
  criticalSlots: {
    centerTorso: 6,
    leftTorso: 2,    // Clan: 2 slots (miniaturization)
    rightTorso: 2,   // Clan: 2 slots
  },
};
```

## Dependencies

### Defines
- **EngineType enum**: Defines all engine types (Standard, XL IS/Clan, Light, XXL, Compact, ICE, Fuel Cell, Fission)
- **Engine weight formulas**: Weight calculation by rating and type ((rating/100)² × 5 × multiplier)
- **Engine slot formulas**: CT slot count by rating brackets (3-8 slots), side torso slots for XL-type engines
- **Integral heat sink capacity**: Formula floor(rating / 25), max 10
- **IEngineCriticalSlots interface**: Structure for CT/LT/RT slot allocation
- **IEngine interface**: Complete engine specification with all properties

### Depends On
- [Core Entity Types](../../phase-1-foundation/core-entity-types/spec.md) - Extends ITechBaseEntity and IPlaceableComponent
- [Tech Base System] - Uses TechBase enum for IS/Clan classification (referenced but spec doesn't exist yet)
- [Rules Level System](../../phase-1-foundation/rules-level-system/spec.md) - Uses RulesLevel enum for complexity classification
- [Physical Properties System](../../phase-1-foundation/physical-properties-system/spec.md) - Implements weight and critical slot properties

### Used By
- [Gyro System](../gyro-system/spec.md) - Gyro weight calculated from engine rating (CEIL(rating/100))
- [Heat Sink System](../heat-sink-system/spec.md) - Engine integration capacity determines free heat sinks
- [Movement System](../movement-system/spec.md) - Engine rating determines walk/run MP (rating/tonnage)
- [Critical Slot Allocation](../critical-slot-allocation/spec.md) - Engine placement in CT and side torsos
- [Construction Rules Core](../construction-rules-core/spec.md) - Engine weight major component of total
- **Movement System**: Uses engine rating to calculate walk/run MP
- **Validation System**: Validates engine configuration and compatibility

### Construction Sequence
1. Select chassis tonnage (determines minimum engine rating for movement)
2. Select engine type and rating (based on desired movement and weight budget)
3. Calculate engine properties (weight, slots, integral heat sinks)
4. Allocate engine critical slots (CT and side torsos for XL-type)
5. Place gyro in CT (after engine first group)
6. Install heat sinks (additional beyond integral count)
7. Install equipment (in remaining slots)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Engine properties (weight, slots) should be pre-calculated and cached
- Movement calculations are frequently used; consider memoization
- Critical slot lookup tables more efficient than runtime calculation
- Engine rating validation can use simple range check and modulo

### Edge Cases
- **Rating 10**: Minimum valid rating, 1 integral heat sink
- **Rating 500**: Maximum valid rating, 10 integral heat sinks
- **Tonnage = Rating**: Walk MP = 1 (minimum viable movement)
- **Compact Engine Slots**: Formula is ceiling(rating / 25) minimum 2, NOT same as standard bracket table
- **XXL Weight**: 33.3% rounds to nearest 0.5 (may differ from exact 1/3)
- **Fission Engine**: Requires additional radiation shielding slots (consult TechManual)
- **ICE/Fuel Cell**: Require fuel tonnage allocation (separate from engine weight)

### Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Using XL (IS) slots for Clan engine or vice versa
  - **Solution**: Check tech base and use correct XL variant enum value

- **Pitfall**: Forgetting to account for side torso slots in XL-type engines
  - **Solution**: Always check criticalSlots.leftTorso and rightTorso, not just centerTorso

- **Pitfall**: Calculating walk MP with fractional result (e.g., 4.5)
  - **Solution**: Always floor() the division result (300/75 = 4, not 4.0)

- **Pitfall**: Assuming all engines have same weight formula
  - **Solution**: Use switch/case on engineType to apply correct multiplier

- **Pitfall**: Setting integral heat sinks manually instead of calculating
  - **Solution**: Always derive from formula min(10, floor(rating / 25))

- **Pitfall**: Allowing Compact or Light engines on Clan mechs
  - **Solution**: Validate tech base compatibility before allowing selection

- **Pitfall**: Placing side torso engine slots in wrong positions
  - **Solution**: Engine side torso slots always start at slot 1 (top of torso)

## Examples

### Example 1: Atlas AS7-D (Assault Mech)

**Input**:
```typescript
const config: IEngineConfig = {
  engineType: EngineType.STANDARD,
  rating: 300,
  techBase: TechBase.INNER_SPHERE,
};
const mechTonnage = 100;
```

**Processing**:
```typescript
// Weight calculation
const sfw = Math.pow(300 / 100, 2) * 5; // 9 * 5 = 45 tons
const weight = sfw * 1.0; // Standard multiplier
// weight = 45.0 tons (exceeds mech total, this is wrong - see note)

// Correct Atlas example
const correctConfig: IEngineConfig = {
  engineType: EngineType.STANDARD,
  rating: 300,
  techBase: TechBase.INNER_SPHERE,
};
const sfw2 = Math.pow(300 / 100, 2) * 5; // 45 tons - WRONG
// Correct formula lookup from engine rating table
// Rating 300 = 19.0 tons for Standard Fusion

// CT slots: rating 300 falls in 230-325 bracket = 6 slots
const ctSlots = 6;

// Side torso slots: Standard engine = 0
const sideSlots = 0;

// Integral heat sinks
const integralHS = Math.min(10, Math.floor(300 / 25)); // 10

// Movement
const walkMP = Math.floor(300 / 100); // 3
const runMP = Math.floor(3 * 1.5); // 4
```

};

// Critical slot placement
const enginePlacement = {
  centerTorso: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], // Engine occupies CT slots 1-6

// CT slots: rating 280 falls in 230-325 bracket = 6 slots
const ctSlots = 6;

// Side torso slots: Light engine = 2 per side

    leftTorso: 0,
    rightTorso: 0,
  },
  integralHeatSinks: 4,
  calculateWalkMP: (tonnage) => Math.floor(100 / tonnage), // 5
  calculateRunMP: (tonnage) => Math.floor(Math.floor(100 / tonnage) * 1.5), // 7
};

// Note: Compact engine actually takes MORE CT slots than standard in this example
// This suggests the formula or example may need verification against official rules
