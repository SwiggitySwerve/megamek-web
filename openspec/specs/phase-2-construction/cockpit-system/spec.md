## Overview

### Purpose
Defines the cockpit system for BattleMechs, including cockpit types, weight requirements, critical slot placement rules, special abilities, and pilot survival mechanics. The cockpit is the command center of a BattleMech, housing the pilot and control systems, and is one of the most critical components affecting mech operation and pilot safety.

### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Cockpit type definitions (Standard, Small, Command Console, Torso-Mounted, Primitive)
- Weight specifications for each cockpit type
- Critical slot placement rules in Head and Center Torso
- Head slot layout with Life Support, Sensors, and Cockpit components
- Special abilities and modifiers (initiative bonuses, piloting penalties, command capabilities)
- Pilot survival and critical hit rules
- Ejection system capabilities
- Tech base variants and availability by era
- Compatibility restrictions with other systems

**Out of Scope:**
- Pilot skill ratings and experience (covered in Pilot System spec)
- Combat damage calculations (covered in Damage System spec)
- Advanced cockpit types for IndustrialMechs (future IndustrialMech spec)
- Interface cockpit and DNI systems (experimental, future Advanced Cockpit spec)
- Dual cockpit configurations for training mechs (specialized variant)
- Vehicle and aerospace cockpits (covered in Vehicle/Aerospace specs)

### Key Concepts
- **Cockpit**: The control center and pilot compartment of a BattleMech, housing the pilot, controls, sensors, and life support
- **Head-Mounted Cockpit**: Standard configuration with cockpit in the Head location (Standard, Small, Command Console, Primitive)
- **Torso-Mounted Cockpit**: Alternative configuration with cockpit in Center Torso, leaving Head available for equipment
- **Life Support**: Critical system maintaining atmospheric and environmental control (2 critical slots in Head)
- **Sensors**: Target acquisition and battlefield awareness systems (2 critical slots in Head)
- **Cockpit Slot**: Single critical slot containing the cockpit control systems (1 slot in Head or CT)
- **Ejection System**: Emergency escape mechanism for pilot survival (not available on all cockpit types)
- **Command Console**: Specialized cockpit providing enhanced command and control for lance/company leadership

## Requirements

### Requirement: Cockpit Type Classification
All BattleMechs SHALL have exactly one cockpit type from the defined set of cockpit variants.

**Rationale**: BattleTech construction rules define specific cockpit types with distinct characteristics, weights, and capabilities. Each mech must have exactly one cockpit.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Standard Cockpit default
**GIVEN** a new BattleMech is being constructed
**WHEN** no cockpit type is explicitly specified
**THEN** Standard Cockpit SHALL be used by default
**AND** weight SHALL be 3 tons

**WHEN** determining pilot survival
**THEN** pilot SHALL survive
**AND** pilot MAY attempt to eject if system available

#### Scenario: Pilot death from cockpit destruction
**GIVEN** a BattleMech takes critical hit to cockpit

## Calculation Formulas

### Cockpit Weight

**Formula**:
```
cockpitWeight = COCKPIT_WEIGHTS[cockpitType]
```

**Where**:
- `cockpitType` = Type of cockpit selected
- `COCKPIT_WEIGHTS` = Constant lookup table

**Values**:
```typescript
const COCKPIT_WEIGHTS: Record<CockpitType, number> = {
  'Standard': 3.0,
  'Small': 2.0,
  'Command Console': 3.0,
  'Torso-Mounted Cockpit': 4.0,
  'Primitive Cockpit': 5.0
}
```

**Example**:
```
Input: cockpitType = 'Small'
Calculation: cockpitWeight = COCKPIT_WEIGHTS['Small']
Output: cockpitWeight = 2.0 tons
```

**Special Cases**:
- Cockpit weight does NOT scale with mech tonnage
- All cockpit weights are fixed constants
- No rounding required (all values are exact)

### Available Head Slots

**Formula**:
```
availableHeadSlots = 6 - fixedHeadSlots[cockpitType]
```

**Where**:
- `fixedHeadSlots` = Number of fixed component slots for cockpit type

**Values**:
```typescript
const FIXED_HEAD_SLOTS: Record<CockpitType, number> = {
  'Standard': 5,          // Life Support (2) + Sensors (2) + Cockpit (1)
  'Small': 5,             // Life Support (2) + Sensors (2) + Cockpit (1)
  'Command Console': 6,   // Life Support (2) + Sensors (2) + Cockpit (1) + Command Console (1)
  'Torso-Mounted Cockpit': 1,  // Only Life Support (1)
  'Primitive Cockpit': 6  // Life Support (2) + Sensors (2) + Cockpit (2)
}
```

**Examples**:
```
Input: cockpitType = 'Standard'
Calculation: availableHeadSlots = 6 - 5
Output: 1 slot available (slot 3)

Input: cockpitType = 'Torso-Mounted Cockpit'
Calculation: availableHeadSlots = 6 - 1
Output: 5 slots available (slots 0-4)

Input: cockpitType = 'Command Console'
Calculation: availableHeadSlots = 6 - 6
Output: 0 slots available
```

### Initiative Modifier

**Formula**:
```
effectiveInitiative = baseInitiative + initiativeModifier[cockpitType]
```

**Where**:
- `baseInitiative` = Base initiative roll result
- `initiativeModifier` = Cockpit-specific modifier

**Values**:
```typescript
const INITIATIVE_MODIFIERS: Record<CockpitType, number> = {
  'Standard': 0,
  'Small': 0,
  'Command Console': -2,  // Acts sooner (better)
  'Torso-Mounted Cockpit': 0,
  'Primitive Cockpit': 0
}
```

**Example**:
```
Input: baseInitiative = 10, cockpitType = 'Command Console'
Calculation: effectiveInitiative = 10 + (-2)
Output: effectiveInitiative = 8 (acts sooner)
```

**Special Cases**:
- Lower initiative numbers act first
- Negative modifier is beneficial
- Only Command Console provides initiative bonus

### Piloting Skill Modifier

**Formula**:
```
effectivePiloting = basePiloting + pilotingModifier[cockpitType]
```

**Where**:
- `basePiloting` = Pilot's base piloting skill
- `pilotingModifier` = Cockpit-specific penalty

**Values**:
```typescript
const PILOTING_MODIFIERS: Record<CockpitType, number> = {
  'Standard': 0,
  'Small': 1,             // +1 penalty (harder to pilot)
  'Command Console': 0,
  'Torso-Mounted Cockpit': 1,  // +1 penalty
  'Primitive Cockpit': 1  // +1 penalty
}
```

**Example**:
```
Input: basePiloting = 4, cockpitType = 'Small'
Calculation: effectivePiloting = 4 + 1
Output: effectivePiloting = 5 (worse skill)
```

**Special Cases**:
- Higher piloting numbers are worse
- Positive modifier is penalty
- Multiple cockpit types impose +1 penalty

## Validation Rules

### Validation: Cockpit Type Compatibility

**Rule**: Torso-Mounted Cockpit is incompatible with XL Gyro

**Severity**: Error

**Condition**:
```typescript
if (cockpitType === 'Torso-Mounted Cockpit' && gyroType === 'XL') {
  // Invalid - XL Gyro uses CT slot 11 needed for cockpit
  return {
    isValid: false,
    violation: {
      type: 'incompatible_gyro',
      message: 'Torso-Mounted Cockpit requires CT slot 11, but XL Gyro occupies slots 7-12',
      severity: 'critical',
      suggestedFix: 'Select Standard, Compact, or Heavy-Duty Gyro instead of XL Gyro'
    }
  };
}
```

**Error Message**: "Torso-Mounted Cockpit is incompatible with XL Gyro. XL Gyro occupies Center Torso slots 7-12, which includes slot 11 required for the cockpit."

**User Action**: Change gyro type to Standard, Compact, or Heavy-Duty, or change cockpit type to head-mounted variant

### Validation: Rules Level Restriction

**Rule**: Small Cockpit and Command Console require Advanced rules level or higher

**Severity**: Warning

**Condition**:
```typescript
if ((cockpitType === 'Small' || cockpitType === 'Command Console') &&
    rulesLevel === 'Standard') {
  return {
    isValid: false,
    violation: {
      type: 'rules_level_violation',
      message: `${cockpitType} requires Advanced or Experimental rules level`,
      severity: 'major',
      suggestedFix: 'Change rules level to Advanced, or use Standard Cockpit'
    }
  };
}
```

**Error Message**: "[Cockpit Type] requires Advanced or Experimental rules level. Current rules level is Standard."

**User Action**: Change rules level to Advanced/Experimental, or select Standard/Primitive cockpit

### Validation: Era Compatibility

**Rule**: Command Console is not available before 3050 (Inner Sphere) or 2828 (Clan)

**Severity**: Warning

**Condition**:
```typescript
if (cockpitType === 'Command Console') {
  const requiredYear = (techBase === 'Clan') ? 2828 : 3050;
  if (constructionYear < requiredYear) {
    return {
      isValid: false,
      violation: {
        type: 'era_incompatible',
        message: `Command Console not available in year ${constructionYear}`,
        severity: 'major',
        suggestedFix: `Use Standard Cockpit or set year to ${requiredYear} or later`
      }
    };
  }
}
```

**Error Message**: "Command Console not available in [year]. Inner Sphere introduction: 3050. Clan introduction: 2828."

**User Action**: Change construction year to appropriate era, or select different cockpit type

### Validation: Cockpit Weight Accuracy

**Rule**: Cockpit weight must match expected weight for cockpit type

**Severity**: Error

**Condition**:
```typescript
const expectedWeight = COCKPIT_WEIGHTS[cockpitType];
if (Math.abs(actualWeight - expectedWeight) > 0.01) {
  return {
    isValid: false,
    violation: {
      type: 'weight_mismatch',
      message: `Cockpit weight is ${actualWeight} tons, expected ${expectedWeight} tons`,
      severity: 'critical',
      suggestedFix: `Recalculate cockpit weight to ${expectedWeight} tons`
    }
  };
}
```

**Error Message**: "Cockpit weight mismatch. Actual: [X] tons, Expected: [Y] tons for [Cockpit Type]."

**User Action**: Recalculate unit weight to use correct cockpit weight

## Tech Base Variants

See [Tech Base Variants Reference](../tech-base-variants-reference/spec.md) for general Inner Sphere vs Clan differences.

### Cockpit-Specific Tech Base Differences

**Minimal Cockpit Differences**:
- Most cockpit types available to both Inner Sphere and Clan
- Weight, slots, and functionality identical between tech bases
- Primary difference is introduction year timing

**Clan-Exclusive Cockpits**:
- No Clan-exclusive standard cockpit types
- Clan versions may have earlier introduction years

**Introduction Year Patterns**:
- Standard Cockpit: Available to both since BattleMech introduction
- Command Console: Inner Sphere invention (3040s)
- Advanced cockpits: Vary by specific type, check component database

**Mixed Tech Application**:
- Cockpit selection generally not affected by tech base choice
- Weight and slot requirements identical
- Use appropriate introduction year for tech base


---

## Dependencies

### Defines
- **CockpitType enum**: Defines five cockpit types (Standard, Small, Command Console, Torso-Mounted, Primitive)
- **Cockpit weights**: Standard 3t, Small 2t, Command Console 3t, Torso-Mounted 4t, Primitive 5t
- **Head slot layouts**: Standard/Small/Primitive use slots 0-5, Torso-Mounted uses CT slot 11
- **Special abilities**: Command Console (lance coordination), Small (piloting penalty), etc.
- **Ejection system rules**: Available on Standard/Command Console/Torso-Mounted, not on Small/Primitive
- **Gyro compatibility**: Torso-Mounted incompatible with XL Gyro (slot conflict)
- **ICockpit interface**: Complete cockpit specification
- **ICockpitConfiguration interface**: Cockpit configuration data

### Depends On
- [Core Entity Types](../../phase-1-foundation/core-entity-types/spec.md) - Extends ITechBaseEntity, ITemporalEntity
- [Physical Properties System](../../phase-1-foundation/physical-properties-system/spec.md) - Weight and critical slot property standards
- [Critical Slot Allocation](../critical-slot-allocation/spec.md) - Head and Center Torso slot structure and placement rules
- [Engine System](../engine-system/spec.md) - Engine type affects heat sink capacity, which affects CT slot availability
- [Gyro System](../gyro-system/spec.md) - Gyro type affects CT slot usage, particularly relevant for Torso-Mounted Cockpit

### Used By
- [Construction Rules Core](../construction-rules-core/spec.md) - Cockpit weight contributes to total, validates cockpit compatibility
- **Pilot System**: Cockpit type affects piloting skill checks and initiative rolls
- **Critical Hit System**: Cockpit critical hits affect pilot survival and mech operation
- **UI Components**: Cockpit selection UI must display weight, slot usage, and special capabilities

### Construction Sequence
1. Select mech tonnage and configuration (determines base structure)
2. Select engine type and rating (determines CT slots for engine)
3. Select gyro type (determines CT slots for gyro, affects Torso-Mounted compatibility)
4. Select cockpit type (this step - determines head/CT slot usage)
5. Allocate heat sinks (uses remaining CT slots after cockpit)
6. Place equipment (uses available head slots determined by cockpit type)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Cockpit weight lookup should use constant-time hash map access
- Head slot layout can be pre-computed for each cockpit type
- Validation rules should short-circuit on first critical error
- Cache cockpit validation results for repeated validations

### Edge Cases
- **XL Gyro + Torso-Mounted Cockpit**: MUST reject this combination. XL Gyro uses CT slots 7-12, which includes slot 11 needed for torso cockpit.
- **Compact Gyro + Torso-Mounted Cockpit**: Valid combination. Compact uses slots 7-8, leaving slot 11 available.
- **Command Console + No Available Head Slots**: Valid design. All 6 head slots are occupied by fixed components.
- **Primitive Cockpit + Modern Era**: Valid but unusual. Some retro designs or captured mechs may use primitive cockpits.
- **Multiple Cockpits**: MUST be rejected. Each mech has exactly one cockpit.
- **Zero Weight Cockpit**: Invalid. All cockpits have minimum weight of 2 tons (Small).

### Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Forgetting that Torso-Mounted Cockpit removes Sensors from head
  - **Solution**: Always check cockpit type before allocating sensor slots
- **Pitfall**: Allowing XL Gyro with Torso-Mounted Cockpit
  - **Solution**: Implement explicit validation rule for this incompatibility
- **Pitfall**: Treating Life Support as 2 slots for Torso-Mounted (it's only 1)
  - **Solution**: Use cockpit-specific head layout configuration
- **Pitfall**: Applying Small Cockpit piloting penalty to Command Console
  - **Solution**: Use per-cockpit-type modifier lookup table
- **Pitfall**: Allowing ejection from Command Console or Torso-Mounted
  - **Solution**: Check ejectionCapable flag before allowing ejection
- **Pitfall**: Forgetting Command Console occupies slot 4 in addition to slot 2
  - **Solution**: Use complete head layout specification for each cockpit type

  slot3: null,            // Available for equipment
  slot4: 'Sensors',       // Fixed
  slot5: 'Life Support'   // Fixed
};

// Step 3: Calculate available slots
const availableHeadSlots = 1; // Only slot 3 available

// Step 4: Check capabilities
const capabilities = {
  ejectionCapable: true,

};
```

**Processing**:
```typescript
// Step 1: Get cockpit weight
const cockpitWeight = COCKPIT_WEIGHTS[CockpitType.SMALL]; // 2.0 tons

// Step 2: Calculate weight savings
const weightSavings = 3.0 - 2.0; // 1.0 ton saved vs Standard

// Step 3: Determine head slot layout (same as Standard)
const headLayout = {
  slot0: 'Life Support',
  slot1: 'Sensors',
  slot2: 'Cockpit',
  slot3: null,            // Available
  slot4: 'Sensors',
  slot5: 'Life Support'
};

// Step 4: Check capabilities and penalties
const capabilities = {
  ejectionCapable: true,
  lifeSupport: true,
  pilotingModifier: 1,    // +1 penalty due to cramped conditions
  consciousnessSupport: true
};
```

**Output**:
```typescript
const result = {

const headLayout = {
  slot0: 'Life Support',
  slot1: 'Sensors',
  slot2: 'Cockpit',
  slot3: null,                 // Could be available, but...
  slot4: 'Command Console',    // Command Console uses this slot
  slot5: 'Life Support'
};

// Step 3: Calculate available slots
const availableHeadSlots = 0; // All slots occupied

// Step 4: Check capabilities
const capabilities = {
  ejectionCapable: false,      // No ejection system
