## Common Patterns Reference

### Pattern 1: The "3-2 Pattern" (Most Common Slot Difference)

**Definition**: Inner Sphere requires 3 critical slots, Clan requires 2 critical slots for the same component

**Applies To**:
- XL Engine side torso slots (IS: 3 per side, Clan: 2 per side)
- Double Heat Sinks external (IS: 3 slots, Clan: 2 slots)

**Rationale**: Clan miniaturization technology reduces space requirements by 1 slot per component

**Impact**:
- Each XL engine saves 2 slots total (1 per side torso)
- Each external DHS saves 1 slot
- On a typical Clan XL mech with 5 external DHS: 2 + 5 = 7 total slots saved

**Example**:
```
Inner Sphere Mech:
- XL Engine 300: 6 CT + 3 LT + 3 RT = 12 total engine slots
- 5 External DHS: 5 × 3 = 15 slots
- Total: 27 slots for engine and heat sinks

Clan Mech (same config):
- XL Engine 300: 6 CT + 2 LT + 2 RT = 10 total engine slots
- 5 External DHS: 5 × 2 = 10 slots
- Total: 20 slots for engine and heat sinks
- SAVINGS: 7 critical slots
```

### Pattern 2: The "14-7 Pattern" (Distributed Systems)

**Definition**: Inner Sphere requires 14 critical slots distributed, Clan requires 7 slots distributed (exactly half)

**Applies To**:
- Endo Steel internal structure (IS: 14 slots, Clan: 7 slots)
- Ferro-Fibrous armor (IS: 14 slots, Clan: 7 slots)

**Rationale**: Advanced materials require distributed integration points; Clan materials science reduces required integration points by 50%

**Distribution Rules**:
- Slots may be distributed across any location except head
- Slots can be split across multiple locations (common: 2-4 slots per location)
- IS typically spreads across 6-8 locations, Clan across 4-7 locations

**Impact**:
- Clan saves 7 slots for each advanced structure or armor type
- Combined Endo Steel + Ferro-Fibrous: 14 total slots saved
- Allows significantly more equipment on Clan mechs

**Example**:
```
Inner Sphere Mech (Endo Steel + Ferro-Fibrous):
- Endo Steel: 14 slots distributed
- Ferro-Fibrous: 14 slots distributed
- Total: 28 slots consumed by structure/armor

Clan Mech (same config):
- Endo Steel: 7 slots distributed
- Ferro-Fibrous: 7 slots distributed
- Total: 14 slots consumed by structure/armor
- SAVINGS: 14 critical slots
```

### Pattern 3: Weight Identity, Slot Difference

**Definition**: Component has identical weight between IS and Clan, but different critical slot requirements

**Applies To**:
- Double Heat Sinks (1 ton both, IS: 3 slots, Clan: 2 slots)
- XL Engines (50% weight both, IS: 6 side slots, Clan: 4 side slots)
- Endo Steel (5% weight both, IS: 14 slots, Clan: 7 slots)
- Most advanced technologies

**Rationale**: Clan miniaturization doesn't always reduce weight, but consistently reduces space requirements

**Impact**: Clan mechs can fit more equipment without weight penalty

**Key Insight**: Weight savings come from component choice (e.g., XL vs Standard), slot savings come from tech base (Clan vs IS)

### Pattern 4: Tech-Exclusive Components

**Definition**: Component available only to one tech base, with no equivalent for the other

**Inner Sphere Exclusive**:
- Light Engine (75% weight, 2 side slots) - Clans use XL instead
- Compact Engine (150% weight, reduced CT slots) - Clan engineering doesn't need
- All advanced Gyros (XL, Compact, Heavy-Duty) - Clans satisfied with Standard
- Triple Strength Myomer (TSM) - Clans consider unreliable
- Light Ferro-Fibrous armor - IS compromise solution
- Heavy Ferro-Fibrous armor - IS alternative to Clan efficiency

**Clan Exclusive**:
- None in structural components (Clan uses superior versions of IS tech)

**Rationale**: Different technological development paths led to different solutions
- IS: Developed intermediate solutions (Light engines, various armor compromises)
- Clan: Maintained and improved original Star League technology (XL engines, Ferro-Fibrous)

### Pattern 5: Introduction Year Gap

**Definition**: Clan technology available significantly earlier (typically 200-275 years) than IS equivalent

**Common Gaps**:
- 200-220 years: Most advanced technologies (XL engines, Endo Steel, Ferro-Fibrous, DHS)
- 275 years: MASC (largest gap documented)
- 30-50 years: Basic technologies (Standard components)
- 0 years: Experimental technologies introduced simultaneously

**Applies To**:

| Technology | IS Year | Clan Year | Gap |
|------------|---------|-----------|-----|
| Double Heat Sinks | 3050 | 2828 | 222 years |
| Ferro-Fibrous Armor | 3040 | 2825 | 215 years |
| XL Engine | 3035 | 2830 | 205 years |
| Endo Steel | 3040 | 2845 | 195 years |
| Improved Jump Jets | 3069 | 2830 | 239 years |
| MASC | 3035 | 2760 | 275 years |
| Command Console | 3050 | 2828 | 222 years |

**Historical Context**:
- Clans left Inner Sphere in 2784 with full Star League technology
- IS suffered Succession Wars technology regression (2785-3049)
- Clan maintained continuous technological advancement
- Clan Invasion (3049-3050) introduced advanced tech to IS
- IS began rediscovering and reverse-engineering Clan tech post-3050

### Pattern 6: Rules Level Difference

**Definition**: Same component classified at different rules rules levels between IS and Clan

**Applies To**:
- XL Engine (IS: Advanced, Clan: Standard)
- Double Heat Sinks (IS: Advanced, Clan: Standard)

**Rationale**:
- Clans adopted advanced technologies earlier and more widely
- Technologies become "standard" with widespread adoption and manufacturing
- IS treats these as advanced/experimental due to limited production and recent introduction

**Impact**:
- Affects tournament legality and campaign availability
- Clan "Standard" units can be more advanced than IS "Standard" units
- Rules level affects tech rating calculations

### Pattern 7: Dual Advantage (Efficiency + Slots)

**Definition**: Clan version has BOTH better efficiency AND fewer slots than IS equivalent

**Applies To**:
- Ferro-Fibrous Armor (Clan: 19.2 pts/ton + 7 slots, IS: 17.92 pts/ton + 14 slots)

**Rationale**: Superior Clan materials science provides compound advantage

**Impact**: Most significant single advantage for Clan technology
- 7% better armor efficiency (can fit more armor in same weight)
- 50% fewer critical slots (7 vs 14)
- Makes Clan Ferro-Fibrous strictly superior to IS version

**Example**:
```
75-ton Mech with 240 total armor points:

Inner Sphere Ferro-Fibrous:
- Weight: 240 / 17.92 = 13.4 tons → rounds to 13.5 tons
- Slots: 14 distributed
- Efficiency: 17.8 pts/ton actual

Clan Ferro-Fibrous:
- Weight: 240 / 19.2 = 12.5 tons
- Slots: 7 distributed
- Efficiency: 19.2 pts/ton actual
- ADVANTAGE: 1.0 ton saved + 7 slots saved
```

### Pattern 8: Same Specs, Different Intro Years

**Definition**: Component has identical specifications but was available to Clans much earlier

**Applies To**:
- Standard components (Standard engine, gyro, heat sinks, etc.) - typically 30 year gap
- Command Console - 222 year gap
- Improved Jump Jets - 239 year gap

**Rationale**:
- Basic technologies have similar implementation
- Clan technological continuity provided earlier access
- IS rediscovered or independently developed same solutions later

**Impact**:
- In era-specific campaigns, Clans have access to more advanced tech
- Same component specs mean no mechanical advantage, just availability advantage

## Tech Base Philosophy and Design Approaches

### Inner Sphere Technology Philosophy

**Development Approach**: Incremental rediscovery and reverse engineering

**Historical Context**:
- Suffered catastrophic technology loss during Succession Wars (2785-3049)
- Prioritized battlefield repair and maintainability over efficiency
- Developed intermediate solutions and compromises
- Post-3050: Rapid advancement through Clan technology recovery and analysis

**Design Characteristics**:
1. **Proven Designs**: Preference for tested, reliable technology over cutting-edge
2. **Distributed Systems**: Technology spreads across more components (14-7 pattern)
3. **Reliability Trade-offs**: Often sacrifice efficiency for robustness
4. **Vulnerability**: Advanced tech like XL engines have greater weaknesses (3 slots vs 2)
5. **Protection Trade-offs**: Weight-saving tech often means more vulnerable points

**Engineering Philosophy**:
- "If it's not broken, don't fix it"
- Easier field repair over optimal performance
- Redundancy and ruggedness valued
- Technology must be manufacturable with available industrial base

**Representative Technologies**:
- Light Engine: Compromise between Standard and XL (75% weight, less vulnerable)
- Light Ferro-Fibrous: Compromise armor (fewer slots than FF, less efficient)
- Triple Strength Myomer: Innovative solution to increase performance

**Typical Inner Sphere Mech**:
```
Chassis: 75 tons
Engine: XL 300 (IS) - 50% weight, 6 side torso slots
Structure: Endo Steel (IS) - 5% weight, 14 slots
Armor: Ferro-Fibrous (IS) - 17.92 pts/ton, 14 slots
Heat Sinks: 10 DHS (IS) - 3 slots each external
Gyro: Standard - reliable, 4 slots

Total Advanced System Slots: 6 (engine sides) + 14 (structure) + 14 (armor) + 9 (3 external DHS) = 43 slots
Weight Savings: Engine 50% + Structure 50% + Armor efficiency
```

### Clan Technology Philosophy

**Development Approach**: Continuous improvement of Star League heritage

**Historical Context**:
- Maintained unbroken technological lineage from Star League exodus (2784)
- Clan Golden Century (2800s-2900s): Perfected advanced technologies
- Never suffered regression or dark ages
- Technology became standardized through consistent production

**Design Characteristics**:
1. **Miniaturization**: Superior materials science reduces space requirements
2. **Efficiency**: Better performance-to-weight ratios
3. **Integration**: More compact component designs (3-2, 14-7 patterns)
4. **Advanced Materials**: Superior alloys and manufacturing processes
5. **Standardization**: Advanced tech is "standard" due to widespread adoption

**Engineering Philosophy**:
- "Perfection through iteration"
- Compact, efficient designs prioritized
- Superior manufacturing enables better tolerances
- Technology must honor Clan warrior traditions

**Representative Technologies**:
- XL Engine (Clan): Only 2 side slots vs IS 3 - better integration
- Endo Steel (Clan): Only 7 slots vs IS 14 - superior materials
- Ferro-Fibrous (Clan): Both more efficient AND fewer slots - compound advantage
- Standard-level advanced tech: XL and DHS are "Standard" rules level

**Typical Clan Mech**:
```
Chassis: 75 tons
Engine: XL 300 (Clan) - 50% weight, 4 side torso slots
Structure: Endo Steel (Clan) - 5% weight, 7 slots
Armor: Ferro-Fibrous (Clan) - 19.2 pts/ton, 7 slots
Heat Sinks: 10 DHS (Clan) - 2 slots each external
Gyro: Standard - no need for advanced types

Total Advanced System Slots: 4 (engine sides) + 7 (structure) + 7 (armor) + 6 (3 external DHS) = 24 slots
Weight Savings: Engine 50% + Structure 50% + Armor efficiency + bonus armor from 19.2 pts/ton
Slot Advantage: 43 (IS) - 24 (Clan) = 19 ADDITIONAL SLOTS for weapons/equipment
```

### Comparative Analysis

| Aspect | Inner Sphere | Clan | Advantage |
|--------|--------------|------|-----------|
| **Weight Efficiency** | Good with advanced tech | Slightly better (armor) | Clan marginal |
| **Critical Slots** | 40-45 slots for advanced systems | 20-25 slots for same systems | Clan significant (15-20 slots) |
| **Tech Availability** | Limited until post-3050 | Widespread in 2800s+ | Clan ~220 years |
| **Reliability** | Prioritized | Assumed | IS design focus |
| **Manufacturing** | Rebuilt post-Succession Wars | Continuous production | Clan |
| **Vulnerability** | More critical hit points (XL 3 slots) | Fewer critical hit points (XL 2 slots) | Clan |
| **Innovation** | Rapid post-3050 | Steady state pre-3050 | IS (post-invasion) |
| **Cost** | Higher for advanced tech | Standard pricing for advanced | Clan |
| **Rules Complexity** | Advanced level | Standard level | Clan (simpler) |

**The Critical Slot Advantage**:
The most significant Clan advantage is critical slot savings:
- Typical advanced IS mech: ~40-45 slots for structure/engine/armor/heat
- Typical advanced Clan mech: ~20-25 slots for same systems
- Advantage: 15-20 additional slots for weapons and equipment
- This translates to more firepower, electronics, or ammunition

**The Introduction Year Advantage**:
In era-based campaigns (2850-3049):
- Clan forces have access to advanced tech for 200+ years
- IS forces limited to Standard technology
- Creates significant technological disparity
- Post-3050: IS begins catching up through salvage and development

- Gyro: Must use IS variants (Standard, XL, Compact, Heavy-Duty)
- Heat Sinks: Must use IS variants (Single, Double IS, Compact, Laser)
- Armor: Must use IS variants (Standard, Ferro-Fibrous IS, Light FF, Heavy FF, Stealth IS, etc.)
- Myomer: Must use IS variants (Standard, TSM, MASC IS)
- Actuators: Must use IS variants
- Movement: Must use IS variants (Jump Jets IS, Improved JJ IS, etc.)
```

#### Option 2: Clan (Pure)
- **Declaration**: `techBase: TechBase.CLAN`
- **Structural Components**: ALL must be Clan variants
- **Equipment**: Can be any tech base (see Equipment Rules below)
- **Tech Rating**: Based on Clan component ratings (typically lower)
- **Advanced Rules Legality**: Standard (if using Introductory/Standard components)

**Structural Component Locking**:
```
LOCKED to Clan:
- Internal Structure: Must use Clan variants (Standard, Endo Steel Clan)
- Engine: Must use Clan variants (Standard, XL Clan, XXL Clan, ICE, Fuel Cell, Fission)
  - NOTE: Light and Compact NOT AVAILABLE to Clan
- Gyro: Must use Clan variants (Standard ONLY - no advanced gyros)
- Heat Sinks: Must use Clan variants (Double Clan ONLY - no singles in practice)
- Armor: Must use Clan variants (Standard, Ferro-Fibrous Clan, Stealth Clan, etc.)
  - NOTE: Light FF and Heavy FF NOT AVAILABLE to Clan
- Myomer: Must use Clan variants (Standard, MASC Clan)
  - NOTE: TSM NOT AVAILABLE to Clan
- Actuators: Must use Clan variants
- Movement: Must use Clan variants (Jump Jets Clan, Improved JJ Clan, etc.)
```

#### Option 3: Mixed Tech
- **Declaration**: `techBase: TechBaseFilter.MIXED`
- **Structural Components**: EACH category independently selects IS or Clan
- **Equipment**: Can be any tech base
- **Tech Rating**: Calculated with Mixed Tech penalty (+1 rating)
- **Advanced Rules Legality**: Advanced or Restricted (mixed tech limited in tournaments)
- **Battle Value**: 1.25× multiplier applied

**Independent Category Selection**:
```
For EACH structural category, select tech base independently:
- Structure: [Inner Sphere | Clan]
- Engine: [Inner Sphere | Clan]
- Gyro: [Inner Sphere | Clan]
- Heat Sinks: [Inner Sphere | Clan]
- Armor: [Inner Sphere | Clan]
- Myomer: [Inner Sphere | Clan]
- Actuators: [Inner Sphere | Clan]
- Movement: [Inner Sphere | Clan]

Example Mixed Configuration:
- Structure: Endo Steel (IS) - 14 slots
- Engine: XL (Clan) - 2 side slots
- Gyro: XL (IS) - 6 CT slots (save weight)
- Heat Sinks: Double (Clan) - 2 slots each
- Armor: Ferro-Fibrous (IS) - 14 slots
- Myomer: MASC (IS) - IS exclusive
- Actuators: Standard (IS)
- Movement: Improved Jump Jets (Clan) - earlier availability

This creates optimal configuration combining best of both tech bases.
```

### Equipment vs Structural Components

**Critical Distinction**: Equipment availability is NOT constrained by unit tech base declaration

**Structural Components** (Tech Base Locked):
- Internal Structure
- Engine
- Gyro
- Heat Sinks (base system)
- Armor
- Myomer/Enhancements
- Actuators
- Movement Systems (Jump Jets, UMU)
- Cockpit

**Equipment** (Year/Era Only):
- Weapons (lasers, autocannons, missiles, etc.)
- Ammunition
- Electronics (ECM, Artemis, BAP, C3, TAG, etc.)
- Physical weapons (claws, hatchets, etc.)
- Optional equipment (cases, supercharger, etc.)
- Heat management equipment (coolant pods, exchanger, etc.)

**Equipment Availability Rules**:
```typescript
// CORRECT: Equipment filtered by year only
if (constructionYear >= equipment.introductionYear) {
  // Equipment is available regardless of unit tech base
  return true;
}

// WRONG: Do NOT filter equipment by unit tech base
if (unit.techBase === TechBase.INNER_SPHERE &&
    equipment.techBase === TechBase.CLAN) {
  return false; // WRONG - this is incorrect validation
}
```

**Example**:
```
Inner Sphere Mech (techBase: INNER_SPHERE), year 3055:
- Structural Components: MUST be Inner Sphere
  - Engine: XL (IS) ✓ Valid
  - Engine: XL (Clan) ✗ Invalid - structural component must match
  - Structure: Endo Steel (IS) ✓ Valid
  - Heat Sinks: Double (IS) ✓ Valid

- Equipment: Year-based ONLY
  - ER Large Laser (Clan) ✓ Valid - introduced 2824, before 3055
  - LRM 15 (IS) ✓ Valid - introduced 2300, before 3055
  - Ultra AC/5 (Clan) ✓ Valid - introduced 2825, before 3055
  - This IS mech CAN use Clan weapons (salvage scenario)

Impact:
- Structural: Pure IS (all IS structural components)
- Equipment: Mixed (uses both IS and Clan weapons)
- Tech Rating: Increased due to equipment mixing
- Tournament legality: May be restricted as "mixed technology"
- NOT declared as "Mixed Tech" but acts similarly
```

### Mixed Tech Construction Rules

**Rule 1: One Type Per Category**
For systems with tech variants, choose ONE variant consistently:
```
Heat Sinks:
✓ Valid: All 15 heat sinks are Double (IS)
✓ Valid: All 15 heat sinks are Double (Clan)
✗ Invalid: Mix of 10 Double (IS) and 5 Double (Clan)

Rationale: Heat sink type must be consistent across entire unit
```

**Rule 2: Tech Base Declaration Per Component**
Each component explicitly declares its tech base:
```typescript
{
  engine: {
    type: 'XL',
    techBase: TechBase.CLAN,  // Explicitly Clan
    rating: 300
  },
  structure: {
    type: 'Endo Steel',
    techBase: TechBase.INNER_SPHERE,  // Explicitly IS
  }
}
```

**Rule 3: Availability Check**
Component must be available to its declared tech base:
```
✓ Valid: XL Engine (Clan) on Mixed Tech unit
✗ Invalid: Light Engine (Clan) - doesn't exist
✓ Valid: Light Engine (IS) on Mixed Tech unit
✗ Invalid: TSM (Clan) - doesn't exist
```

**Rule 4: Weight and Slot Calculations**
Mixed tech units calculate properties per-component:
```typescript
For each component:
  1. Use component's declared tech base
  2. Apply that tech base's weight formula
  3. Apply that tech base's slot requirements
  4. Sum all components for total weight/slots

Example:
- XL Engine (Clan): Uses Clan XL formula (50% weight, 2 side slots)
- Endo Steel (IS): Uses IS formula (5% weight, 14 slots)
- Ferro-Fibrous (Clan): Uses Clan formula (19.2 pts/ton, 7 slots)
```

**Rule 5: Tech Rating Escalation**
Mixed tech increases unit tech rating:
```typescript
Unit Tech Rating = MAX(
  Base chassis tech rating,
  Highest component tech rating,
  Mixed tech penalty (if IS using Clan tech: +1)
)

Example:
- IS mech (Standard rating) using Clan DHS (Standard rating Clan)
- Mixed tech penalty: +1
- Result: Advanced tech rating
```

**Rule 6: Battle Value Modifier**
Mixed Tech units have BV multiplier:
```
Pure IS or Pure Clan: BV × 1.0 (no modifier)
Mixed Tech declared: BV × 1.25 (+25% increase)

Rationale: Mixed tech units more complex to maintain and operate
```

### Tech Base Memory System

For Mixed Tech units, the system remembers component selections when toggling categories:

```typescript
interface ITechBaseMemory {
  structure: {
    [TechBase.INNER_SPHERE]: 'Endo Steel',
    [TechBase.CLAN]: 'Endo Steel (Clan)'
  },
  engine: {
    [TechBase.INNER_SPHERE]: 'Light',
    [TechBase.CLAN]: 'XL (Clan)'
  },
  // ... for each category
}

// User flow:
1. User selects Mixed Tech
2. Sets Engine category to "Inner Sphere", selects "Light Engine"
3. Toggles Engine category to "Clan", selects "XL (Clan)"
4. Toggles back to "Inner Sphere"
5. System restores "Light Engine" (previous IS selection)
```

This allows users to experiment with different tech base combinations without losing work.

## Component Availability Matrices

### Matrix: Internal Structure

| Structure Type | Inner Sphere | Clan | Rules Level | Special Notes |
|----------------|--------------|------|-------------|---------------|
| Standard | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Introductory | Universal baseline |
| Endo Steel | ✓ Available (14 slots) | ✓ Available (7 slots) | Standard | Clan uses half the slots |
| Endo-Composite | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Experimental | Identical specs |
| Reinforced | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Advanced | Identical specs |
| Composite | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Experimental | Identical specs |
| Industrial | ✓ Available | ✗ Not Available | Introductory | IndustrialMechs only |

**Key Insight**: Clan has access to all IS structure types except Industrial. Primary difference is slot reduction for Endo Steel (14→7).

### Matrix: Engines

| Engine Type | Inner Sphere | Clan | Rules Level IS | Rules Level Clan | Special Notes |
|-------------|--------------|------|----------------|------------------|---------------|
| Standard Fusion | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Introductory | Introductory | Universal baseline |
| XL | ✓ Available (3 side slots) | ✓ Available (2 side slots) | Advanced | **Standard** | Clan saves 2 slots, lower rules level |
| XXL | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Experimental | Experimental | Identical specs |

| ICE | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Introductory | Introductory | Identical specs |
| Fuel Cell | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Advanced | Advanced | Identical specs |
| Fission | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Primitive | Primitive | Identical specs |

**Key Insight**: Clans have NO access to Light or Compact engines. Clans treat XL as Standard rules level (widespread adoption). IS has more engine variety (Light, Compact) as interim solutions.

### Matrix: Gyroscopes

| Gyro Type | Inner Sphere | Clan | Rules Level | Special Notes |
|-----------|--------------|------|-------------|---------------|
| Standard | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Introductory | Identical specs |
| XL | ✓ Available | ✗ **Not Available** | Advanced | IS-exclusive |
| Compact | ✓ Available | ✗ **Not Available** | Advanced | IS-exclusive |
| Heavy-Duty | ✓ Available | ✗ **Not Available** | Advanced | IS-exclusive |

**Key Insight**: Clan uses ONLY Standard Gyro. All advanced gyro types are IS-exclusive. Clans see no need for gyro variants beyond proven Standard.

### Matrix: Heat Sinks

| Heat Sink Type | Inner Sphere | Clan | External Slots IS | External Slots Clan | Rules Level IS | Rules Level Clan |
|----------------|--------------|------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|------------------|
| Single | ✓ Available | ✓ Available (not used) | 1 | 1 | Introductory | Introductory |
| Double | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 3 | 2 | Advanced | **Standard** |
| Compact | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 1 | 1 | Advanced | Advanced |
| Laser | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 1 | 1 | Experimental | Experimental |

**Key Insight**: Clan Double Heat Sinks are Standard rules level (vs IS Advanced). Clan forces do not use Single Heat Sinks in practice (all use Double). Clan saves 1 slot per external DHS (3→2).

### Matrix: Armor

| Armor Type | Inner Sphere | Clan | Pts/Ton IS | Pts/Ton Clan | Slots IS | Slots Clan | Special Notes |
|------------|--------------|------|------------|--------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Standard | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 16 | 16 | 0 | 0 | Universal baseline |
| Ferro-Fibrous | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 17.92 | **19.2** | 14 | 7 | Clan dual advantage |

| Reflective | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 16 | 16 | 10 | 10 | Identical specs |
| Hardened | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 8 | 8 | 0 | 0 | Identical specs |

**Key Insight**: Clan Ferro-Fibrous has BOTH better efficiency (19.2 vs 17.92) AND fewer slots (7 vs 14) - most significant single advantage. IS developed Light and Heavy FF as alternatives/compromises.

### Matrix: Cockpits

| Cockpit Type | Inner Sphere | Clan | Weight | Slots | Special Notes |
|--------------|--------------|------|--------|-------|---------------|
| Standard | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 3 tons | 1 head | Universal baseline |
| Small | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 2 tons | 1 head | Identical specs |
| Command Console | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 3 tons | 1 head + 3 CT | Different intro years (3050 IS, 2828 Clan) |
| Torso-Mounted | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 4 tons | 2 CT | Identical specs |
| Interface | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 3 tons | 1 head | Identical specs |

**Key Insight**: Cockpits have minimal tech base differences. Primary distinction is introduction years. Command Console shows typical ~220 year Clan advantage.

### Matrix: Movement Systems

| Movement Type | Inner Sphere | Clan | Weight Formula | Slots | Special Notes |
|---------------|--------------|------|----------------|-------|---------------|
| Standard Jump Jets | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | By tonnage class | 1 per JJ | Identical mechanics |
| Improved Jump Jets | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | 2× standard | 2 per JJ (IS)<br/>2 per JJ (Clan) | Different intro years (3069 IS, 2830 Clan) |
| Jump Booster | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Special | Varies (IS)<br/>2 (Clan) | Clan version fewer slots |
| UMU | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | By tonnage class | 1 per UMU | Identical mechanics |

**Key Insight**: Movement systems largely identical. Jump Jets same formulas and slots. Improved JJ shows ~239 year Clan introduction advantage.

### Matrix: Myomer and Enhancements

| Component | Inner Sphere | Clan | Weight | Slots | Special Notes |
|-----------|--------------|------|--------|-------|---------------|
| Standard Myomer | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Included in structure | 0 | Universal baseline |
| Standard Actuators | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Included in structure | 1 per | Universal baseline |
| TSM | ✓ Available | ✗ **Not Available** | Special | 6 distributed | IS-exclusive |
| MASC | ✓ Available | ✓ Available | Tonnage-based | Tonnage-based | Identical specs, different intro (3035 IS, 2760 Clan) |

**Key Insight**: Triple Strength Myomer (TSM) is IS-exclusive - Clans consider it unreliable. MASC available to both with identical specs but 275-year Clan introduction advantage (largest gap documented).

### Validation Rule: Equipment Tech Base Independence

**Rule**: Equipment must NOT be validated against unit tech base, only against year/era

**Severity**: Info (not an error - this is allowed)

**Validation Logic**:
```typescript
// CORRECT validation
for (const equipment of unit.equipment) {
  // Check year availability
  if (equipment.introductionYear > unit.constructionYear) {
    return {
      valid: false,
      error: `${equipment.name} not available until ${equipment.introductionYear}`,

  // DO NOT check tech base compatibility for equipment
  // Equipment can be used regardless of unit tech base
}
```

**Info Messages** (not errors):
| Condition | Info Message | Impact |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| IS unit with Clan weapons | "Unit uses Clan weapons on Inner Sphere chassis. This is valid (salvage scenario) but may increase tech rating and affect tournament legality." | Tech rating may increase, tournament restricted |

### Validation Rule: Heat Sink Type Consistency

**Rule**: For systems with tech variants, choose ONE variant consistently across entire unit

**Severity**: Error (inconsistent configuration)

**Validation Logic**:
```typescript
// Heat Sink Type Consistency
const heatSinkTypes = new Set();

for (const heatSink of unit.heatSinks) {

## Summary Statistics

### Critical Slot Savings (Clan vs IS)

**Typical Advanced Technology Mech Comparison**:

| Component | IS Slots | Clan Slots | Savings |
|-----------|----------|------------|---------|
| XL Engine (side torsos) | 6 | 4 | 2 |
| Endo Steel Structure | 14 | 7 | 7 |
| Ferro-Fibrous Armor | 14 | 7 | 7 |
| 5 External Double Heat Sinks | 15 | 10 | 5 |
| **TOTAL** | **49** | **28** | **21 slots** |

**Result**: Clan mech has 21 additional critical slots for weapons, ammunition, and equipment compared to equivalent IS mech.

### Introduction Year Gaps

**Average Gaps by Technology Category**:
- Advanced Structural (XL, Endo, FF): ~200-220 years Clan advantage
- Heat Management (DHS): ~222 years Clan advantage
- Movement (Improved JJ): ~239 years Clan advantage
- Enhancements (MASC): ~275 years Clan advantage (largest gap)
- Basic Tech (Standard components): ~30 years Clan advantage

**Historical Periods**:
- 2439-2784: Star League era (both sides have similar basic tech)
- 2784-3049: Clan maintains tech, IS regresses (largest gaps)
- 3050+: IS begins catching up through salvage and development

### Tech Base Exclusive Components

**Inner Sphere Exclusive**:
- Light Engine
- Compact Engine
- XL Gyro
- Compact Gyro
- Heavy-Duty Gyro
- Triple Strength Myomer
- Light Ferro-Fibrous Armor
- Heavy Ferro-Fibrous Armor

**Total**: 8 IS-exclusive technologies (interim solutions and alternatives)

**Clan Exclusive**:
- None in structural components (Clan uses superior versions of IS tech)

### Rules Level Distribution

**Standard Level Components**:
- IS: Standard Engine, Standard Structure, Standard Armor, Standard Gyro, Single Heat Sinks
- Clan: All above PLUS XL Engine, Double Heat Sinks

**Impact**: Clan "Standard" units can use XL engines and DHS, while IS "Standard" limited to basic tech.

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

**This document is your first stop for any tech base question**:
1. Check the appropriate comparison matrix
2. Reference the validation rules for implementation
3. Use individual component specs for detailed formulas
4. Cite this document in code comments for tech base logic

**Example Code Comment**:
```typescript
// Using Clan XL Engine: 2 side slots per torso (not 3 like IS)
// See: Tech Base Rules Matrix - Engines Matrix
// Pattern: 3-2 Side Torso Slots
const clanXLSideSlots = 2;
```

### For Specification Authors

**Reference this document instead of duplicating**:
- Link to specific matrices for tech base comparisons
- Reference patterns by name (e.g., "follows 14-7 Pattern")
- Focus your spec on component-specific formulas and mechanics
- Defer tech base philosophy and validation to this document

**Example Spec Reference**:
```markdown
## Tech Base Variants

See [Tech Base Rules Matrix](../tech-base-rules-matrix/spec.md) for complete
tech base comparison. This component follows the "3-2 Pattern" for slot allocation.

### Component-Specific Details
[Component-specific implementation details only]
