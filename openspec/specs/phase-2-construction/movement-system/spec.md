### Scope
**In Scope:**
- Walk MP and Run MP calculation formulas
- Jump MP mechanics and limitations
- Jump Jet types and variants (Standard, Improved, Extended, UMU, Mechanical, Partial Wing)
- Jump Jet weight calculation by mech tonnage class
- Jump Jet critical slot requirements
- Jump Jet placement rules and restrictions
- Movement enhancement systems (MASC, Supercharger, TSM)
- Movement type classifications (Biped, Quad, Tracked, Wheeled, VTOL, etc.)
- Movement heat generation
- Movement modifiers (terrain, damage, actuator loss)
- Maximum movement limitations
- Tech base variants for movement equipment

**Out of Scope:**
- Engine system implementation details (covered in Engine System spec)
- Engine rating calculations (covered in Engine System spec)

## Requirements

### Requirement: Walk Movement Calculation
The system SHALL calculate walk movement points based on engine rating and mech tonnage using the official formula.

**Rationale**: Walk MP is the fundamental movement rate determining tactical mobility.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Standard walk calculation
**GIVEN** a mech with engine rating R and tonnage T
**WHEN** calculating walk MP
**THEN** walk MP = floor(R / T)
**AND** result MUST be rounded down to nearest integer
**AND** minimum walk MP SHALL be 1 (if engine provides sufficient rating)

#### Scenario: High-speed light mech
**GIVEN** a 20-ton mech with rating 160 engine
**WHEN** calculating walk MP
**THEN** walk MP = floor(160 / 20) = 8
**AND** this represents very fast movement

#### Scenario: Slow assault mech
**GIVEN** a 100-ton mech with rating 300 engine
**WHEN** calculating walk MP
**THEN** walk MP = floor(300 / 100) = 3
**AND** this represents typical assault mech speed

#### Scenario: Underpowered engine warning
**GIVEN** engine rating less than mech tonnage
**WHEN** calculating walk MP
**THEN** walk MP = 0 or less
**AND** system SHALL emit critical error
**AND** mech SHALL be invalid (no functional movement)

### Requirement: Run Movement Calculation
The system SHALL calculate run movement points as 1.5× walk MP rounded down.

**Rationale**: Running represents sprinting at increased speed with heat penalties.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Standard run calculation
**GIVEN** walk MP of W
**WHEN** calculating run MP
**THEN** run MP = floor(W × 1.5)
**AND** result MUST be rounded down to nearest integer

**GIVEN** walk MP = 4
**WHEN** calculating run MP
**THEN** run MP = floor(4 × 1.5) = floor(6) = 6

#### Scenario: Odd walk MP run calculation
**GIVEN** walk MP = 5
**WHEN** calculating run MP
**THEN** run MP = floor(5 × 1.5) = floor(7.5) = 7
**AND** fractional MP SHALL be discarded

#### Scenario: Maximum walk MP run calculation
**GIVEN** walk MP = 8 (maximum practical)
**WHEN** calculating run MP
**THEN** run MP = floor(8 × 1.5) = floor(12) = 12

**THEN** jump MP = 0
**AND** mech CANNOT perform jumping movement

#### Scenario: Improved jump jets
**GIVEN** improved jump jets installed
**WHEN** calculating jump MP
**THEN** jump MP follows same 1 MP per jet rule
**AND** jump MP MUST NOT exceed walk MP
**AND** improved jets provide same MP but different benefits

#### Scenario: Extended jump jets
**GIVEN** extended jump jets installed
**WHEN** calculating jump MP
**THEN** jump MP MUST NOT exceed run MP (extended limit)
**AND** this allows higher jump capability than standard

### Requirement: Jump Jet Weight Calculation

**Rationale**: Jump jet weight scales with mech size to maintain balance.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Light mech jump jet weight
**GIVEN** mech tonnage ≤ 55 tons
**WHEN** calculating jump jet weight
**THEN** each standard jump jet weighs 0.5 tons

#### Scenario: Medium/Heavy mech jump jet weight

**AND** MUST occupy both side torsos (3 slots each)
**AND** placement in legs or center torso SHALL be rejected

### Requirement: Movement Enhancement - MASC

**AND** walk MP increases by 1 (net: +2 from TSM, -1 from heat)
**AND** run MP = ceiling(walk × 1.5) using TSM walk

#### Scenario: TSM with base walk 4
**GIVEN** walk MP = 4 and TSM active (9+ heat)
**WHEN** calculating movement
**THEN** walk MP = 4 + 1 = 5
**AND** run MP = ceiling(5 × 1.5) = ceiling(7.5) = 8

#### Scenario: TSM below activation threshold
**GIVEN** walk MP = 4 and TSM installed but heat < 9
**WHEN** calculating movement
**THEN** walk MP = 4 (no TSM bonus)
**AND** run MP = floor(4 × 1.5) = 6

#### Scenario: TSM ceiling calculation
**GIVEN** TSM active with walk MP = W
**WHEN** calculating run MP
**THEN** run MP = ceiling(W × 1.5)
**AND** uses ceiling instead of floor (unlike standard calculation)

**WHEN** attempting to install TSM
**THEN** installation SHALL be rejected
**AND** error SHALL indicate TSM and MASC are mutually exclusive

**WHEN** calculating total jump jet weight
**THEN** partial wing weight = tonnage-based fixed weight
**AND** jump jet weight = (N × weight per jet) × 0.5
**AND** total weight = partial wing weight + discounted jet weight

#### Scenario: 55-ton mech with partial wing and 5 jump jets
**GIVEN** 55-ton mech with partial wing and 5 standard jump jets
**WHEN** calculating weight
**THEN** partial wing = 2.0 tons (fixed for ≤55t)
**AND** jump jets without wing = 5 × 0.5 = 2.5 tons
**AND** jump jets with wing = 2.5 × 0.5 = 1.25 tons
**AND** total = 2.0 + 1.25 = 3.25 tons (rounded to 3.5)

**GIVEN** VTOL unit
**WHEN** determining movement type
**THEN** movement type SHALL be VTOL
**AND** movement SHALL be airborne by default

### Requirement: Maximum Movement Limitations
The system SHALL enforce maximum movement limitations based on construction rules.

**Rationale**: Game balance and construction rules limit maximum practical movement.

**Priority**: High

**GIVEN** any BattleMech
**WHEN** validating walk MP
**THEN** practical maximum walk MP SHOULD be 8
**AND** walk MP > 8 MAY trigger warning
**AND** walk MP > 8 requires very high engine rating

#### Scenario: Maximum run MP

## Calculation Formulas

### Walk MP Formula

**Formula**:
```
walkMP = floor(engineRating / mechTonnage)
```

**Where**:
- `engineRating` = Engine rating (10-500, multiples of 5)
- `mechTonnage` = Mech tonnage (20-100 for standard BattleMechs)
- `floor()` = Round down to nearest integer

**Example**:
```
Input: engineRating = 300, mechTonnage = 75
Calculation: walkMP = floor(300 / 75) = floor(4) = 4
Output: walkMP = 4

Input: engineRating = 280, mechTonnage = 55
Calculation: walkMP = floor(280 / 55) = floor(5.09) = 5
Output: walkMP = 5
```

**Special Cases**:
- When engineRating < mechTonnage: walkMP = 0 (invalid, engine too weak)
- When engineRating = mechTonnage: walkMP = 1 (minimum viable)
- When walkMP > 8: Very fast mech, requires high engine rating

**Rounding Rules**:
- Always round down (floor function)
- No fractional movement points allowed

### Run MP Formula

**Formula**:
```
runMP = floor(walkMP × 1.5)
```

**Where**:
- `walkMP` = Walk movement points (calculated above)
- `floor()` = Round down to nearest integer

**Example**:
```
Input: walkMP = 4
Calculation: runMP = floor(4 × 1.5) = floor(6) = 6
Output: runMP = 6

Input: walkMP = 5
Calculation: runMP = floor(5 × 1.5) = floor(7.5) = 7
Output: runMP = 7
```

**Special Cases**:
- Even walkMP: runMP = walkMP × 1.5 exactly (no rounding loss)
- Odd walkMP: runMP loses 0.5 MP to rounding

**Rounding Rules**:
- Always round down (floor function)
- Examples: 6.0 → 6, 7.5 → 7, 9.0 → 9

### Enhanced Run MP with Supercharger

**Formula**:
```
enhancedRunMP = floor(walkMP × 2.0)
```

**Where**:
- `walkMP` = Current walk MP (may be TSM-enhanced)
- `floor()` = Round down to nearest integer

**Example**:
```
Input: walkMP = 4, has Supercharger
Calculation: enhancedRunMP = floor(4 × 2.0) = 8
Output: runMP = 8 (instead of standard 6)

Input: walkMP = 5 (TSM active), has Supercharger
Calculation: enhancedRunMP = floor(5 × 2.0) = 10
Output: runMP = 10
```

**Special Cases**:
- Supercharger replaces standard run calculation
- If TSM active: uses TSM-boosted walk MP as base
- If both Supercharger and MASC: see combined formula below

### Sprint MP with MASC

**Formula**:
```
sprintMP = floor(walkMP × 2.0)
```

**Where**:
- `walkMP` = Current walk MP
- Available only when MASC is activated

**Example**:
```
Input: walkMP = 4, MASC activated
Calculation: sprintMP = floor(4 × 2.0) = 8
Output: can move up to 8 hexes this turn
```

**Special Cases**:
- MASC and TSM are mutually exclusive (cannot coexist)
- MASC activation generates heat and risks equipment damage
- Sprint replaces run for that turn

### Combined MASC + Supercharger Formula

**Formula**:
```
sprintMP = floor(walkMP × 2.5)
```

**Where**:
- `walkMP` = Current walk MP
- Both MASC and Supercharger must be installed
- MASC must be activated

**Example**:
```
Input: walkMP = 4, has both MASC and Supercharger, MASC activated
Calculation: sprintMP = floor(4 × 2.5) = floor(10) = 10
Output: can move up to 10 hexes this turn
```

**Special Cases**:
- Most extreme speed boost available
- High heat generation and MASC damage risk

### TSM Enhanced Walk MP Formula

**Formula**:
```
enhancedWalkMP = baseWalkMP + 1
```

**Where**:
- `baseWalkMP` = Normal walk MP from engine
- TSM must be active (heat >= 9)
- Net effect: +2 from TSM, -1 from heat penalty = +1

**Example**:
```
Input: baseWalkMP = 4, heat = 10 (TSM active)
Calculation: enhancedWalkMP = 4 + 1 = 5
Output: walkMP = 5 when heat >= 9
```

**Special Cases**:
- Below 9 heat: enhancedWalkMP = baseWalkMP (TSM inactive)
- At or above 9 heat: enhancedWalkMP = baseWalkMP + 1

### TSM Enhanced Run MP Formula

**Formula**:
```
enhancedRunMP = ceiling(enhancedWalkMP × 1.5)
```

**Where**:
- `enhancedWalkMP` = TSM-boosted walk MP
- `ceiling()` = Round UP to nearest integer (unique to TSM)

**Example**:
```
Input: enhancedWalkMP = 5 (TSM active)
Calculation: enhancedRunMP = ceiling(5 × 1.5) = ceiling(7.5) = 8
Output: runMP = 8 (instead of floor = 7)
```

**Special Cases**:
- TSM uses ceiling instead of floor for run calculation
- This is unique to TSM; standard calculation uses floor

### Jump MP Formula

**Formula**:
```
For Standard/Improved/UMU/Extended jump jets:
  jumpMP = numberOfJumpJets

For Mechanical Jump Booster:
  jumpMP = 1 (regardless of count)

For Partial Wing:
  jumpMP = 0 (does not provide jump MP)
```

**Where**:
- `numberOfJumpJets` = Count of jump jets installed
- Does not include partial wing in count

**Example**:
```
Input: 5 standard jump jets installed
Calculation: jumpMP = 5
Output: jumpMP = 5

Input: 1 mechanical jump booster installed
Calculation: jumpMP = 1 (maximum allowed)
Output: jumpMP = 1
```

**Special Cases**:
- Standard jets: jumpMP ≤ walkMP (hard limit)
- Extended jets: jumpMP ≤ runMP (higher limit)
- Mechanical booster: jumpMP = 1 exactly (cannot exceed)

**Rounding Rules**:
- No rounding needed (always integer count)

### Jump Jet Weight Formula

**Formula**:
```
For Standard/Improved/Extended/UMU/Jump Booster/Prototype:
  if mechTonnage <= 55:
    weightPerJet = 0.5 tons
  else if mechTonnage <= 85:
    weightPerJet = 1.0 ton
  else:
    weightPerJet = 2.0 tons

  totalWeight = weightPerJet × numberOfJets

For Mechanical Jump Booster:
  totalWeight = mechTonnage × 0.1 × jumpMP

For Partial Wing:
  if mechTonnage <= 55:
    partialWingWeight = 2.0 tons
  else if mechTonnage <= 85:
    partialWingWeight = 3.0 tons
  else:
    partialWingWeight = 5.0 tons
```

**Where**:
- `mechTonnage` = Mech tonnage class
- `numberOfJets` = Count of jump jets installed
- `jumpMP` = Jump movement points (for mechanical booster)

**Example**:
```
Input: mechTonnage = 55, numberOfJets = 5 (standard)
Calculation: weightPerJet = 0.5, totalWeight = 0.5 × 5 = 2.5 tons
Output: 2.5 tons

Input: mechTonnage = 75, numberOfJets = 4 (standard)
Calculation: weightPerJet = 1.0, totalWeight = 1.0 × 4 = 4.0 tons
Output: 4.0 tons

Input: mechTonnage = 100, numberOfJets = 3 (standard)
Calculation: weightPerJet = 2.0, totalWeight = 2.0 × 3 = 6.0 tons
Output: 6.0 tons
```

**Special Cases**:
- Tonnage exactly 55: uses 0.5 tons per jet (light bracket)
- Tonnage exactly 56: uses 1.0 ton per jet (medium bracket)
- Tonnage exactly 85: uses 1.0 ton per jet (medium bracket)
- Tonnage exactly 86: uses 2.0 tons per jet (assault bracket)

### Partial Wing Weight Discount Formula

**Formula**:
```
otherJetWeight = weightPerJet × numberOfJets
discountedJetWeight = otherJetWeight × 0.5
totalWeight = partialWingWeight + discountedJetWeight
```

**Where**:
- `partialWingWeight` = Fixed weight for partial wing (tonnage-based)
- `otherJetWeight` = Weight of other jump jets before discount
- 50% discount applied to other jump jets only

**Example**:
```
Input: mechTonnage = 55, partialWing = true, 5 standard jump jets
Calculation:
  partialWingWeight = 2.0 tons
  otherJetWeight = 5 × 0.5 = 2.5 tons
  discountedJetWeight = 2.5 × 0.5 = 1.25 tons
  totalWeight = 2.0 + 1.25 = 3.25 tons → 3.5 tons
Output: 3.5 tons total
```

**Special Cases**:
- Partial wing without other jets: invalid configuration
- Discount applies only to standard jump jet types
- Mechanical jump booster not affected by partial wing

**Rounding Rules**:
- Final weight rounded to nearest 0.5 ton

### Jump Heat Generation Formula

**Formula**:
```
For Standard/Improved/Extended/UMU/Mechanical/Jump Booster:
  heatGenerated = jumpMP × 1

For Prototype Jump Jet:
  heatGenerated = jumpMP × 2

For Partial Wing:
  heatGenerated = 0 (wing itself)
```

**Where**:
- `jumpMP` = Distance jumped in hexes
- Heat is per hex jumped

**Example**:
```
Input: jump 4 hexes with standard jump jets
Calculation: heatGenerated = 4 × 1 = 4 points
Output: 4 heat

Input: jump 3 hexes with prototype jump jets
Calculation: heatGenerated = 3 × 2 = 6 points
Output: 6 heat
```

**Special Cases**:
- Partial wing generates no heat itself
- Jump jets with partial wing still generate their normal heat
- Heat is only generated when jumping, not when installed

## Tech Base Variants

See [Tech Base Variants Reference](../tech-base-variants-reference/spec.md) for general Inner Sphere vs Clan differences.

### Movement System Tech Base Differences

**No Direct Movement Formula Differences**:
- Walk MP = engine rating / tonnage (identical formula for both)
- Run MP = walk MP × 1.5 (identical formula for both)
- Jump MP = jump jet count (identical calculation for both)

**Indirect Tech Base Effects**:
- Engine weight differences affect available tonnage for equipment
- XL engine slot differences affect jump jet placement options
- No difference in movement calculation itself

**Component Availability**:
- Standard jump jets: Available to both tech bases
- Improved jump jets: Check specific introduction years by tech base
- Mechanical jump boosters: Availability varies

**Mixed Tech Application**:
- Movement calculation remains tech-base independent
- Use engine's specific tech base for weight/slot calculations
- Final movement capacity depends on engine rating and tonnage


---

## Dependencies

### Defines
- **Walk MP formula**: floor(engineRating / tonnage)
- **Run MP formula**: floor(walkMP × 1.5)
- **Jump MP mechanics**: Typically 1 MP per jump jet, max ≤ walkMP
- **JumpJetType enum**: Standard, Improved, Extended, UMU, Mechanical, Partial Wing, Jump Booster
- **Jump jet weight brackets**: Light (≤55t) 0.5t, Medium (60-85t) 1.0t, Heavy (90-100t) 2.0t
- **Jump jet slot requirements**: Most 1 slot, Improved 2 slots
- **MASC mechanics**: Sprint at 2× run MP, failure risks
- **Supercharger mechanics**: Increased run to 2× walk MP
- **TSM mechanics**: Movement bonus at high heat (9+ heat)
- **IJumpJet interface**: Jump jet specification
- **IMovementConfiguration interface**: Complete movement configuration

### Depends On
- [Engine System](../engine-system/spec.md) - Uses engine rating to calculate walk MP (rating/tonnage)
- [Core Entity Types](../../phase-1-foundation/core-entity-types/spec.md) - IJumpJet extends ITechBaseEntity and IPlaceableComponent
- [Tech Base System] - Uses TechBase enum for IS/Clan classification (referenced but spec doesn't exist yet)
- [Rules Level System](../../phase-1-foundation/rules-level-system/spec.md) - Uses RulesLevel enum for technology availability
- [Physical Properties System](../../phase-1-foundation/physical-properties-system/spec.md) - Implements weight and critical slot properties

### Used By
- [Construction Rules Core](../construction-rules-core/spec.md) - Movement affects mech validity, jump jet weight contributes to total
- [Critical Slot Allocation](../critical-slot-allocation/spec.md) - Jump jets and enhancements occupy slots
- **Heat Management System**: Movement generates heat requiring dissipation (jumping, MASC, running)
- **Battle Value Calculation**: Movement affects combat value
- **Combat System**: Movement determines tactical positioning

### Construction Sequence
1. Select chassis (tonnage determines jump jet weight bracket)
2. Select engine (engine rating determines walk/run MP)
3. Calculate base movement: walk = floor(rating/tonnage), run = floor(walk × 1.5)
4. Install jump jets (select type, calculate weight and slots)
5. Install movement enhancements (MASC, Supercharger, or TSM if desired)
6. Calculate enhanced movement (apply modifiers from enhancements)
7. Validate movement (check all movement constraints and limits)
8. Allocate critical slots (place jump jets and enhancements in valid locations)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Movement calculations are frequently used; consider caching results
- Jump jet weight lookup table faster than runtime calculation
- Pre-calculate movement brackets for common tonnage classes
- Movement display string should be memoized for UI performance

### Edge Cases
- **Tonnage = 55**: Use 0.5t jump jet weight (light bracket boundary)
- **Tonnage = 56**: Use 1.0t jump jet weight (medium bracket boundary)
- **Tonnage = 85**: Use 1.0t jump jet weight (medium bracket boundary)
- **Tonnage = 86**: Use 2.0t jump jet weight (assault bracket boundary)
- **Walk MP = 0**: Invalid configuration, engine too weak
- **Walk MP > 8**: Rare but valid, extremely fast mech
- **Partial Wing Alone**: Invalid, must have other jump jets
- **Mechanical Booster > 1 MP**: Invalid, hard limit of 1 MP
- **MASC + TSM**: Invalid, mutually exclusive
- **TSM Below 9 Heat**: No bonus, acts as dead weight
- **Supercharger + TSM**: Valid, Supercharger uses TSM-boosted walk

### Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Using floor for TSM run calculation
  - **Solution**: TSM uses ceiling for run MP calculation (unique behavior)

- **Pitfall**: Forgetting partial wing requires other jump jets
  - **Solution**: Validate partial wing always has companion jump jets

- **Pitfall**: Allowing MASC and TSM together
  - **Solution**: Check mutual exclusivity before allowing installation

- **Pitfall**: Wrong weight bracket for 55/56 or 85/86 ton mechs
  - **Solution**: Use <= for lower bound, > for upper bound in conditionals

- **Pitfall**: Allowing jump jets in arms or head
  - **Solution**: Validate location against allowed list (CT, LT, RT, LL, RL only)

- **Pitfall**: Not applying partial wing discount correctly
  - **Solution**: Calculate other jet weight first, then apply 50% discount, then add wing weight

- **Pitfall**: Forgetting supercharger must be in engine location
  - **Solution**: Check location has engine critical slots before allowing placement

- **Pitfall**: Calculating enhanced run before enhanced walk
  - **Solution**: Apply walk modifiers first, then calculate run from modified walk

  techBase: TechBase.CLAN,
};
```

**Processing**:
```typescript
// Movement calculation
const walkMP = Math.floor(375 / 75); // 5
const runMP = Math.floor(5 * 1.5); // 7

// Jump booster weight (medium bracket: 56-85 tons = 1.0t each)
const boosterWeight = 5 * 1.0; // 5.0 tons

// Jump booster slots (Clan improved variant)
const boosterSlots = 5 * 2; // 10 slots (2 per booster)

// Jump MP
const jumpMP = 5; // Valid, 5 ≤ 5

// Heat
const jumpHeat = 5 * 1; // 5 heat
```

**Output**:
```typescript
const movement: IMovementProfile = {
  walkMP: 5,
  runMP: 7,
  jumpMP: 5,
  movementType: MovementType.BIPED,
  displayString: '5 / 7 / 5',
};

const jumpConfig: IJumpJetConfiguration = {
  jumpJetCounts: { 'Jump Booster': 5 },
  hasPartialWing: false,
  totalJumpMP: 5,
  totalWeight: 5.0,
  totalCriticalSlots: 10,
  heatGeneration: 5,
};
```
