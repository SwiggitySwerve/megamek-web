# toast-notifications Specification

## Purpose

Provides transient feedback notifications for user actions and system events throughout the application. Uses a React context provider pattern for app-wide availability. Includes specialized hooks for P2P sync event notifications (useSyncNotifications, useSyncToasts).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Toast Provider Architecture

The toast system SHALL use a React context provider pattern for app-wide availability.

#### Scenario: Provider mounting

- **THEN** useToast hook is available in all child components
- **AND** toast container renders at bottom-right of viewport

#### Scenario: Hook usage

- **WHEN** component calls useToast()
- **THEN** showToast, dismissToast, and dismissAll functions are returned
- **AND** calling showToast displays a new toast notification

#### Scenario: Missing provider

- **WHEN** useToast is called outside ToastProvider
- **THEN** error is thrown with helpful message

### Requirement: Toast Variants

The toast system SHALL support four semantic variants with distinct styling.

#### Scenario: Success toast

- **WHEN** showToast is called with variant "success"

- **AND** green border and checkmark icon
- **AND** appropriate for confirming completed actions

#### Scenario: Error toast

- **WHEN** showToast is called with variant "error"

### Requirement: Auto-Dismiss Behavior

Toasts SHALL automatically dismiss after a configurable duration.

#### Scenario: Default auto-dismiss

- **WHEN** toast is displayed without custom duration
- **THEN** toast auto-dismisses after 3000ms (3 seconds)

#### Scenario: Custom duration

- **WHEN** showToast is called with duration parameter
- **THEN** toast auto-dismisses after specified milliseconds

#### Scenario: Persistent toast

- **WHEN** showToast is called with duration of 0
- **THEN** toast remains until manually dismissed

### Requirement: Manual Dismissal

Users SHALL be able to manually dismiss toasts.

#### Scenario: Dismiss button

- **WHEN** toast is displayed
- **THEN** X button appears on right side of toast

#### Scenario: Dismiss button accessibility

- **WHEN** dismiss button is rendered
- **THEN** button has aria-label="Dismiss notification"

### Requirement: Sync Notifications Hook

The useSyncNotifications hook SHALL provide notification functions for P2P sync events.

**Source**: `src/hooks/useSyncNotifications.ts#useSyncNotifications; src/hooks/useSyncNotifications.helpers.ts#buildShareReceivedToast, #buildConflictToast, #buildSyncCompleteToast, #buildConnectionChangedToast`

#### Scenario: Share received notification

## Non-Goals

This specification does NOT cover:

1. **Toast Persistence** - Toasts are transient UI elements, not persistent notifications
2. **Notification History** - No log or history of dismissed toasts
3. **Toast Queuing** - Multiple toasts stack vertically but are not queued
4. **Custom Toast Components** - Only predefined variants (success, error, warning, info)
5. **Toast Positioning** - Fixed at bottom-right viewport, not configurable
6. **P2P Sync Implementation** - Only covers toast notifications for sync events, not sync logic itself
7. **Conflict Resolution UI** - useSyncNotifications provides callbacks, but conflict resolution UI is out of scope
