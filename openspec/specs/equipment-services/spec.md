### Requirement: Equipment Filter Functions with Hardcoded IDs

Equipment filter functions SHALL use hardcoded ID lists for filtering equipment from unit loadouts.

**Rationale**: Filter functions need to identify equipment types without async loading.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Filter out heat sinks
- **GIVEN** a unit's equipment list
- **WHEN** calling `filterOutHeatSinks(equipment)`
- **THEN** system SHALL use `HEAT_SINK_EQUIPMENT_IDS` constant
- **AND** constant SHALL include all heat sink IDs
- **AND** return equipment array without heat sink entries

#### Scenario: Filter out jump jets
- **GIVEN** a unit's equipment list
- **WHEN** calling `filterOutJumpJets(equipment)`
- **THEN** system SHALL use `JUMP_JET_EQUIPMENT_IDS` constant
- **AND** constant SHALL include all jump jet IDs
- **AND** return equipment array without jump jet entries

#### Scenario: Filter out targeting computers
- **GIVEN** a unit's equipment list
- **WHEN** calling `filterOutTargetingComputer(equipment)`
- **THEN** system SHALL use `TARGETING_COMPUTER_IDS` constant
- **AND** constant SHALL include IS and Clan targeting computer IDs
- **AND** return equipment array without targeting computer entries

#### Scenario: Filter out enhancements
- **GIVEN** a unit's equipment list
- **WHEN** calling `filterOutEnhancementEquipment(equipment)`
- **THEN** system SHALL use `ENHANCEMENT_EQUIPMENT_IDS` constant
- **AND** constant SHALL include MASC, TSM, and Supercharger IDs
- **AND** return equipment array without enhancement entries
