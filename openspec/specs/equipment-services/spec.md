---

### Requirement: JSON Equipment Loading

The system SHALL load equipment definitions from JSON files at runtime.

**Rationale**: Data-driven equipment enables updates without code changes and supports user customization.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Load official equipment

- **GIVEN** the application is initializing
- **WHEN** EquipmentLoaderService.loadOfficialEquipment() is called
- **THEN** `loadOfficialEquipmentSource` SHALL discover files from
  `public/data/equipment/official/index.json` when that index is available
- **AND** load every mapped JSON file into the loader category maps
- **AND** when the index or a category map is unavailable, recover with the
  matching `EquipmentLoaderConfig` default file list as a separate recovery
  case; a present category map remains topology authority
- **AND** return IEquipmentLoadResult with success, itemsLoaded, errors, and
  warnings

#### Scenario: Load weapon categories

- **GIVEN** official equipment is being loaded
- **WHEN** processing weapon files
- **THEN** read the `weapons` file map from
  `public/data/equipment/official/index.json`
- **AND** load every mapped split file (currently including
  `weapons/energy-laser.json`, `weapons/energy-ppc.json`,
  `weapons/energy-other.json`, the split ballistic and missile files, and
  `weapons/physical.json`)
- **AND** do not require obsolete aggregate paths such as
  `weapons/energy.json` or `weapons/ballistic.json`
- **AND** convert raw JSON to typed IWeapon objects

#### Scenario: Load other equipment

  from `public/data/equipment/official/index.json`
- **AND** load each mapped split file under its category directory
- **AND** do not require obsolete aggregate paths such as `ammunition.json`,
  `electronics.json`, or `miscellaneous.json`
- **AND** convert to appropriate typed objects (IAmmunition, IElectronics, IMiscEquipment)

#### Scenario: Equipment load failure

- **GIVEN** a mapped official JSON file is missing, unreadable, or fails JSON
  parse
- **WHEN** `EquipmentLoaderService.loadOfficialEquipment()` processes the
  current file list
- **THEN** `readJsonFile` SHALL return null after a path-bearing warning
- **AND** `loadOfficialEquipmentSource` SHALL record a path-bearing error and
  warning
- **AND** continue loading remaining files across `weapons`, `ammunition`,
  `electronics`, and `miscellaneous`
- **AND** keep successfully converted rows in the category maps
- **AND** count those retained rows in `IEquipmentLoadResult.itemsLoaded`
- **AND** return `success: false`
- **AND** `getIsLoaded()` SHALL equal `result.success` (false)
- **AND** `getLoadErrors()` SHALL equal `result.errors`
- **AND** this continuation SHALL apply only to read, JSON-parse, missing, and
  unreadable failures — not to schema-drift throws

#### Scenario: Strict schema-bridge drift stops traversal

- **GIVEN** `NODE_ENV` is not `production` and
  `MEKSTATION_STRICT_SCHEMA_BRIDGE=1`
- **AND** a mapped file reads as JSON but `validateShapeFromFile` finds
  schema-invalid rows
- **WHEN** `loadOfficialEquipmentSource` runs the schema-bridge gate
- **THEN** `validateShape` SHALL throw before converting that file's rows
- **AND** the outer catch in `loadOfficialEquipmentSource` SHALL stop remaining
  file traversal
- **AND** the catch SHALL append `Failed to load equipment: ${e}` to `errors`
- **AND** return `success: false` with `itemsLoaded` equal to rows converted
  before the throw
- **AND** `getIsLoaded()` SHALL equal `result.success` (false)
- **AND** this path SHALL NOT continue remaining mapped files

#### Scenario: Successful retry after partial load failure

- **GIVEN** a previous official load recorded file-level errors while retaining
  successful rows
- **WHEN** `loadOfficialEquipment()` is called again and every mapped file loads
- **THEN** return `IEquipmentLoadResult` with `success: true`, empty `errors`,
  and empty `warnings`
- **AND** `getIsLoaded()` SHALL equal `result.success` (true)
- **AND** `getLoadErrors()` SHALL be empty

---

### Requirement: Custom Equipment Loading

The system SHALL load user-defined equipment from custom JSON files.

**Rationale**: Users can extend the equipment database with custom or homebrew items.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Load custom equipment from file

- **AND** validate enum values (TechBase, RulesLevel)
- **AND** return validation errors for invalid data

#### Scenario: Custom equipment ID conflicts

- **GIVEN** custom equipment has same ID as official equipment
- **WHEN** loading custom equipment
- **THEN** custom equipment SHALL override official equipment
- **AND** log a warning about the override

---

### Requirement: Equipment Registry

The system SHALL maintain an in-memory registry of all loaded equipment.

**Rationale**: Fast lookup by ID or name without repeated file access.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Register equipment

- **GIVEN** equipment data is loaded from JSON
- **WHEN** EquipmentRegistry.register(item) is called
- **THEN** store the item indexed by ID
- **AND** create name-to-ID mapping for lookup

#### Scenario: Get by ID

- **GIVEN** equipment is registered
- **WHEN** EquipmentRegistry.getById("medium-laser") is called
- **THEN** return the equipment object
- **AND** return null if ID not found

- **THEN** return array of matching equipment
- **AND** support filtering by category, techBase, rulesLevel, and name

---

### Requirement: Equipment Name Mapping

The system SHALL map MTF equipment names to canonical IDs.

**Rationale**: MegaMek files use various naming conventions that must resolve to canonical equipment.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Load name mappings

- **GIVEN** the application is initializing
- **WHEN** EquipmentNameMapper is initialized
- **THEN** load mappings from `public/data/equipment/name-mappings.json`

#### Scenario: Resolve canonical ID

- **GIVEN** an MTF equipment name "Medium Laser"
- **WHEN** EquipmentNameMapper.getCanonicalId("Medium Laser") is called
- **THEN** return "medium-laser"

#### Scenario: Resolve legacy names

- **GIVEN** an MTF uses legacy name "AC/20"
- **WHEN** EquipmentNameMapper.getCanonicalId("AC/20") is called
- **THEN** return "autocannon-20"

#### Scenario: Unknown equipment name

- **GIVEN** an unrecognized equipment name
- **WHEN** EquipmentNameMapper.getCanonicalId("Unknown Weapon") is called
- **THEN** return null
- **AND** log a warning for later review

#### Scenario: Add custom mapping

- **GIVEN** a user wants to add a custom name mapping
- **WHEN** EquipmentNameMapper.addMapping("Custom Laser", "custom-laser-id") is called
- **THEN** store the mapping for future lookups

---

### Requirement: Canonical Equipment ID Normalization

The system SHALL expose exactly one canonical `normalizeEquipmentId` function,
the catalog-driven normalizer that resolves an arbitrary equipment ID or name
against the equipment catalog, name mappings, alias maps, abbreviation maps, and
regex patterns, and every equipment-resolution pipeline (MTF import, unit-loader
resolution, simulation-runner hydration, and BV catalog lookup) SHALL route
equipment-ID normalization through it. No pipeline SHALL maintain a divergent
local normalization implementation; any same-named local export SHALL be a
re-export shim that delegates to the canonical function.

#### Scenario: Same input resolves identically across all pipelines

- **GIVEN** an ambiguous equipment input such as "Ultra AC/5" or "Rotary AC/5"
- **WHEN** the MTF importer, the unit-loader resolution path, the simulation
  hydration path, and the BV catalog lookup each normalize that input
- **THEN** all four SHALL produce the same canonical equipment key
- **AND** the key SHALL be the one the canonical catalog-driven normalizer
  returns

#### Scenario: Divergent local normalizers are removed

- **GIVEN** a pipeline previously held its own `normalizeEquipmentId`
  implementation
- **WHEN** that pipeline normalizes an equipment ID after this change
- **THEN** it SHALL call the canonical normalizer directly or through a thin
  site-specific adapter
- **AND** no two pipelines SHALL return different canonical keys for the same
  input

#### Scenario: Site-specific context is supplied at the adapter boundary

- **GIVEN** a pipeline that requires extra context to normalize, such as a unit
  tech base for Clan/IS disambiguation or ammo-key shaping
- **WHEN** that pipeline normalizes an equipment ID
- **THEN** the context SHALL be supplied to a thin adapter that delegates to the
  canonical normalizer
- **AND** the canonical normalizer SHALL NOT be forked into a context-specific

#### Scenario: Catalog availability on the hydration path

- **GIVEN** the simulation-runner hydration path normalizes equipment before the
  equipment catalog is loaded
- **WHEN** the canonical normalizer is invoked on that path
- **THEN** the catalog SHALL be available, loaded, or pre-warmed so normalization
  resolves against the catalog rather than degrading to a lossy fallback

---

### Requirement: Equipment Schema Validation

The system SHALL validate equipment data against JSON Schema definitions.

**Rationale**: Schema validation ensures data integrity and catches errors early.

**Priority**: Medium

#### Scenario: Validate weapon data

- **GIVEN** weapon JSON data is loaded
- **WHEN** validation is performed
- **THEN** check against `public/data/equipment/_schema/weapon-schema.json`
- **AND** return validation errors if schema violations found

#### Scenario: Validate ammunition data

- **GIVEN** ammunition JSON data is loaded
- **WHEN** validation is performed
- **THEN** check against `public/data/equipment/_schema/ammunition-schema.json`

#### Scenario: Validation result structure

- **GIVEN** equipment data is validated
- **WHEN** returning validation result
- **THEN** return IEquipmentValidationResult with isValid boolean and errors array

---

### Requirement: Equipment Loader Initialization State

The EquipmentLoaderService SHALL track its loading state and provide status information.

**Rationale**: Consumers need to know if equipment data is available before querying.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Check loaded state

- **GIVEN** the equipment loader has been instantiated
- **WHEN** calling `getIsLoaded()`
- **THEN** return `true` only if the last `loadOfficialEquipment()` returned
  `IEquipmentLoadResult.success`
- **AND** return `false` before the first load, or when that result recorded any
  file-level errors
- **AND** `getIsLoaded()` SHALL equal that result's `success` flag
- **AND** retained successful rows SHALL remain queryable from the loader maps
  even when this flag is false

#### Scenario: Get total count

- **GIVEN** the equipment loader has loaded data
- **WHEN** calling `getTotalCount()`
- **THEN** return sum of all loaded equipment items across all categories

#### Scenario: Get load errors

- **GIVEN** the equipment loader attempted to load data
- **WHEN** calling `getLoadErrors()`
- **THEN** return the path-bearing error messages from the last official load
- **AND** include failures from each of the four indexed categories when those
  mapped files fail
- **AND** return an empty array after a clean successful load or retry

### Requirement: Equipment Lookup Service Initialization

The EquipmentLookupService SHALL support async initialization and track data source.

**Rationale**: Service must coordinate JSON loading and fallback selection.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Initialize service

- **GIVEN** a new EquipmentLookupService instance
- **WHEN** calling `initialize()`
- **THEN** system SHALL attempt to load from EquipmentLoaderService
- **AND** system SHALL be idempotent (subsequent calls return same promise)
- **AND** system SHALL set `initialized` flag to true when complete

#### Scenario: Check initialization state

- **GIVEN** the lookup service exists
- **WHEN** calling `isInitialized()`
- **THEN** return `true` if `initialize()` has completed
- **AND** return `false` if not yet initialized

#### Scenario: Get data source

- **GIVEN** the lookup service has initialized
- **WHEN** calling `getDataSource()`
- **THEN** return `'json'` only if the last official load succeeded
  (`IEquipmentLoadResult.success`) and loaded at least 100 items
- **AND** return `'fallback'` if that load failed, recorded file-level errors,
  or loaded fewer than 100 items

#### Scenario: Get load result

- **GIVEN** the lookup service has initialized
- **WHEN** calling `getLoadResult()`
- **THEN** return the IEquipmentLoadResult from the loader
- **AND** return null if not yet initialized

---

### Requirement: Equipment Lookup Fallback Behavior

Equipment utility functions SHALL fall back to hardcoded definitions when JSON
data is unavailable.

**Rationale**: Construction utilities must work immediately without waiting for async loading.

**Priority**: Critical

This fallback is limited to runtime utility lookup. It is not official catalog
data and SHALL NOT be used to satisfy official equipment validation, combat
parity, or catalog completeness checks. Those checks must report a missing
source-backed row as a gap.

#### Scenario: Heat sink equipment lookup

- **GIVEN** heat sink equipment is requested
- **WHEN** calling `getHeatSinkEquipment(type)`
- **THEN** system SHALL call `getEquipmentLoader()` and use JSON data only when
  `getIsLoaded()` is true
- **AND** then try `getMiscEquipmentById(id)`
- **AND** if the loader is not loaded or the ID is missing, return from
  `HEAT_SINK_FALLBACKS[id]`
- **AND** fallback SHALL include all standard heat sink types

#### Scenario: Jump jet equipment lookup

- **GIVEN** jump jet equipment is requested
- **WHEN** calling `getJumpJetEquipment(tonnage, type)`
- **THEN** system SHALL call `getEquipmentLoader()` and use JSON data only when
  `getIsLoaded()` is true
- **AND** then try `getMiscEquipmentById(id)`
- **AND** if the loader is not loaded or the ID is missing, return from
  `JUMP_JET_FALLBACKS[id]`
- **AND** fallback SHALL include light/medium/heavy standard and improved jets

#### Scenario: Targeting computer equipment lookup

- **GIVEN** targeting computer equipment is requested
- **WHEN** calling `getTargetingComputerEquipment(techBase)`
- **THEN** system SHALL call `getEquipmentLoader()` and use JSON data only when
  `getIsLoaded()` is true
- **AND** then try `getElectronicsById(id)`
- **AND** if the loader is not loaded or the ID is missing, return from
  `TARGETING_COMPUTER_FALLBACKS[id]`
- **AND** fallback SHALL include IS and Clan targeting computers

#### Scenario: Enhancement equipment lookup

- **GIVEN** movement enhancement equipment is requested (MASC, TSM, Supercharger)
- **WHEN** calling `getEnhancementEquipment(type, techBase)`
- **THEN** system SHALL call `getEquipmentLoader()` and use JSON data only when
  `getIsLoaded()` is true
- **AND** then try `getMiscEquipmentById(id)`
- **AND** if the loader is not loaded or the ID is missing, return from
  `ENHANCEMENT_FALLBACKS[id]`
- **AND** fallback SHALL include MASC (IS/Clan), TSM, and Supercharger

### Requirement: Equipment Filter Functions with Hardcoded IDs

Equipment filter functions SHALL use hardcoded ID lists for filtering equipment from unit loadouts.

**Rationale**: Filter functions need to identify equipment types without async loading.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Filter out heat sinks

- **GIVEN** a unit's equipment list
- **WHEN** calling `filterOutHeatSinks(equipment)`
- **THEN** system SHALL use `HEAT_SINK_EQUIPMENT_IDS` constant
- **AND** constant SHALL include all heat sink IDs
- **AND** return equipment array without heat sink entries

#### Scenario: Filter out jump jets

- **GIVEN** a unit's equipment list
- **WHEN** calling `filterOutJumpJets(equipment)`
- **THEN** system SHALL use `JUMP_JET_EQUIPMENT_IDS` constant
- **AND** constant SHALL include all jump jet IDs
- **AND** return equipment array without jump jet entries

#### Scenario: Filter out targeting computers

- **GIVEN** a unit's equipment list
- **WHEN** calling `filterOutTargetingComputer(equipment)`
- **THEN** system SHALL use `TARGETING_COMPUTER_IDS` constant
- **AND** constant SHALL include IS and Clan targeting computer IDs
- **AND** return equipment array without targeting computer entries

#### Scenario: Filter out enhancements

- **GIVEN** a unit's equipment list
- **WHEN** calling `filterOutEnhancementEquipment(equipment)`
- **THEN** system SHALL use `ENHANCEMENT_EQUIPMENT_IDS` constant
- **AND** constant SHALL include MASC, TSM, and Supercharger IDs
- **AND** return equipment array without enhancement entries
