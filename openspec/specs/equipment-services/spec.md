**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Calculate Targeting Computer weight
- **GIVEN** a mech with 10 tons of direct-fire weapons
- **WHEN** calculateProperties("targeting-computer-is", context) is called

- **AND** evaluate cost formula: 3 × 10000 = 30000
- **AND** return { weight: 3, criticalSlots: 3, cost: 30000 }

#### Scenario: Calculate MASC weight
- **GIVEN** a mech with engine rating 300 and 75 tons

- **AND** return weight = 15, criticalSlots = 15

#### Scenario: Calculate physical weapon properties with damage
- **GIVEN** a 75-ton mech
- **WHEN** calculateProperties("hatchet", { tonnage: 75 }) is called
- **THEN** evaluate weight formula: ceil(75 / 15) = 5 tons
- **AND** evaluate slots formula: EQUALS_WEIGHT = 5
