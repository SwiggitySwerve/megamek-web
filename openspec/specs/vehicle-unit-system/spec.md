# vehicle-unit-system Specification

## Purpose

Define the complete construction, state management, BLK parsing, customizer UI workflow, and validation rules for the Vehicle unit type — encompassing **combat vehicles** (tanks, APCs, naval), **VTOLs**, and **support vehicles** (civilian/logistics). Vehicles are the most common non-Mech unit type in BattleTech, featuring dual handler architecture, a turret system unique among unit types, and motion-type-driven configuration.

## Non-Goals

- Combat mechanics (damage resolution, motive hits, critical effects) — OUT OF SCOPE
- Record sheet PDF rendering — covered by separate spec
- Equipment database contents — covered by `equipment-database` spec
- BattleMech-specific construction (gyro, actuators, critical slots) — covered by Phase 2 construction specs

- **THEN** cost SHALL include:
  - Structure: `tonnage × 10,000`
  - Engine: `engineRating × 5,000`
  - Armor: `totalArmorPoints × 10,000`

#### Scenario: Support vehicle cost calculation

- **WHEN** calculating cost for a support vehicle
- **THEN** cost SHALL include:
  - Chassis: `tonnage × 5,000`
  - Engine: `engineRating × 2,000` (if mobile)
  - Armor: `totalArmorPoints × 5,000 × (barRating / 10)`
  - Cargo: `cargoCapacity × 1,000`

### Requirement: Vehicle BV Breakdown on Unit State

Every `IVehicleUnit` SHALL carry an `IVehicleBVBreakdown` populated by the calculator.

#### Scenario: Breakdown shape

- **GIVEN** a vehicle after construction completes
- **WHEN** BV is computed
- **THEN** `unit.bvBreakdown` SHALL contain at minimum: `defensive`, `offensive`, `pilotMultiplier`, `turretModifier`, `final`

#### Scenario: Breakdown recomputed on construction edit

- **GIVEN** an existing vehicle with BV 1100
- **WHEN** the user adds 6 tons of weapons via the equipment tab
- **THEN** `unit.bvBreakdown.offensive` SHALL increase
- **AND** `unit.bvBreakdown.final` SHALL update live

### Requirement: BV Parity Harness for Vehicles

The validation tooling SHALL produce a vehicle BV parity report.

#### Scenario: Vehicle validation report

- **WHEN** the vehicle BV validator runs
- **THEN** it SHALL emit `validation-output/vehicle-bv-validation-report.json`
- **AND** the report SHALL include per-unit: `unitName`, `computedBV`, `mulBV`, `delta`, `deltaPct`

### Requirement: Motive Damage State Tracking

Vehicle units SHALL carry a motive-damage state struct updated by combat resolution.

#### Scenario: Motive damage counters

- **GIVEN** any `IVehicleUnit`
- **WHEN** the combat state is constructed
- **THEN** `unit.combatState.motive` SHALL contain `originalCruiseMP`, `penaltyMP`, `immobilized`, `sinking`, `turretLocked`, `engineHits`, `driverHits`, `commanderHits`, `crewStunnedPhases`

#### Scenario: Motive penalty applies to flank MP

- **GIVEN** a vehicle with original cruise 5, flank 7 (floor(5×1.5)=7) and penalty 2
- **WHEN** effective MP is computed
- **THEN** effective cruise SHALL equal 3 (5 − 2)
- **AND** effective flank SHALL equal 4 (floor(3 × 1.5))

#### Scenario: Cumulative motive penalties

- **GIVEN** a vehicle with cumulative motive penalty already at −3
- **WHEN** another motive-damage roll applies −2
- **THEN** penalty SHALL become −5
- **AND** effective cruise MP SHALL not go below 0

### Requirement: Vehicle Engine Critical Immobilizes (Not Destroys)

A vehicle engine critical hit SHALL immobilize the vehicle rather than deterministically destroy it. Engine hits SHALL increment the engine-hit counter and force the vehicle immobilized, setting effective cruise and flank MP to zero. A second engine hit SHALL NOT set `destroyed`. Deterministic destruction on engine hit is removed; the MegaMek optional fusion-explosion destruction rule is out of scope and SHALL NOT be applied as a guaranteed outcome.

#### Scenario: Second engine hit immobilizes but does not destroy

- **GIVEN** a combat vehicle that has already taken one engine critical hit
- **WHEN** the vehicle takes a second engine critical hit
- **THEN** `motive.engineHits` SHALL increment to 2
- **AND** the vehicle SHALL be immobilized, with effective cruise and flank MP equal to 0
- **AND** the vehicle SHALL NOT be flagged `destroyed`
- **AND** the vehicle SHALL NOT report `destructionCause: 'engine_destroyed'` from the engine-hit path alone

#### Scenario: First engine hit immobilizes

- **GIVEN** an undamaged combat vehicle
- **WHEN** the vehicle takes its first engine critical hit
- **THEN** `motive.engineHits` SHALL be 1
- **AND** the vehicle SHALL be immobilized

### Requirement: Motive Damage Roll Modifiers by Motion Type

Vehicle motive damage SHALL apply a flat per-motion-type modifier to the motive-damage 2d6 roll, matching MegaMek, rather than escalating a heavy severity result directly to immobilized for specific motion types. The resulting motive severity SHALL be derived from the modified roll on the motive-damage table.

#### Scenario: Motion-type modifier feeds the motive roll

- **GIVEN** a hover vehicle with motive-roll modifier +3 and a wheeled vehicle with modifier +2
- **WHEN** a motive-damage roll is resolved for each
- **THEN** each vehicle's motive-damage 2d6 roll SHALL be adjusted by its motion-type modifier before the motive-damage table is consulted
- **AND** the resulting severity SHALL be the table outcome of the modified roll, not a heavy-to-immobilized shortcut keyed on motion type

#### Scenario: Tracked vehicle takes the unmodified table outcome

- **GIVEN** a tracked vehicle with motive-roll modifier +0
- **WHEN** a motive-damage roll is resolved
- **THEN** the motive severity SHALL be the unmodified table outcome of the roll

### Requirement: Single-Source Vehicle Crew Critical Effects

Vehicle crew critical effects, including driver and commander hits, SHALL be resolved through a single authoritative crew-critical escalation shared with the production vehicle-critical table layer, so the BA-leg-attack-reachable helper and the table layer cannot diverge. The non-CASE ammo explosion crew-wound value SHALL be 2, consistent across all vehicle and mech critical paths.

#### Scenario: Driver/commander helper matches the table layer

- **GIVEN** a vehicle receives a driver or commander critical hit via the BA-leg-attack helper
- **WHEN** the crew-critical effect is resolved
- **THEN** the resulting crew state SHALL equal the state produced by the production vehicle-critical table layer for the same hit
- **AND** a commander hit SHALL still apply its crew-stun side effect

#### Scenario: Unprotected vehicle ammo explosion inflicts two crew wounds

- **GIVEN** an ammo bin explodes in a vehicle location without CASE
- **WHEN** crew damage is assessed
- **THEN** the crew SHALL take 2 wounds, not 1, consistent with the mech non-CASE explosion rule
