- **AND** Sort takes precedence over Compact when both are enabled

#### Scenario: Fill action execution
- **WHEN** user clicks Fill button
- **THEN** all unallocated unhittable equipment (Endo Steel, Ferro-Fibrous slots) is distributed
- **AND** distribution alternates evenly between paired locations
- **AND** distribution follows priority: LT/RT first, then LA/RA, then LL/RL, then CT, then Head

#### Scenario: Fill distribution order
- **GIVEN** 14 unallocated Endo Steel slots
- **WHEN** Fill action executes
- **THEN** slots 1-2 go to LT and RT (alternating: LT, RT, LT, RT...)
