# Auto-Save and State Persistence Specification

**Status**: Active
**Version**: 1.1
**Last Updated**: 2026-09-12
**Dependencies**: toast-notifications (useToast)
**Affects**: unit-builder, game-session-management

---

## Overview

### Purpose

This specification defines the auto-save and state persistence subsystem for MekStation. It provides three React hooks for managing application state persistence: `useAutoSaveIndicator` for toast-based save feedback, `usePersistedState` for localStorage-backed state with JSON serialization, and `useGameStatePersistence` for full game state autosave with conflict detection and beforeunload warnings.

### Scope

**In Scope:**

- Auto-save indicator with receipt-driven toast notifications
- Generic localStorage-backed state hook with JSON serialization
- Game state persistence with autosave intervals and debouncing
- Conflict detection for concurrent save operations
- Beforeunload warning for unsaved changes
- Storage key constants for UI preferences

**Out of Scope:**

- Database persistence (SQLite, IndexedDB)
- Server-side synchronization
- Multi-tab state synchronization
- State migration between schema versions
- Undo/redo functionality
- Compression or encryption of stored data

### Key Concepts

- **Auto-Save Indicator**: Visual feedback (toast) shown after a completed customizer-draft storage write receipt for the active `AutoSaveIndicatorTarget`
- **Persisted State**: React state synchronized with localStorage, supporting functional updates and JSON serialization
- **Game State Persistence**: Full game state autosave with configurable intervals, debouncing, conflict detection, and unsaved change warnings
- **Conflict Detection**: Timestamp-based detection of concurrent save operations to prevent data loss
- **Debouncing**: Delay before autosave triggers after state change, preventing excessive writes during rapid edits

---
## Requirements
### Requirement: Auto-Save Indicator

The system SHALL provide a `useAutoSaveIndicator` hook that accepts an `AutoSaveIndicatorTarget` (`unitId` and `unitType`) or null, subscribes to completed storage write receipts for that target's customizer draft key, and displays draft-persistence toasts from those receipts.

**Source**: `src/hooks/useAutoSaveIndicator.ts#useAutoSaveIndicator`

**Rationale**: Users need visual confirmation that their work is being saved without intrusive notifications on every keystroke.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Show success toast after saved write receipt

**GIVEN** the hook is mounted with an `AutoSaveIndicatorTarget`
**WHEN** a completed storage write receipt arrives for the derived draft storage key with status `saved`
**THEN** a 500ms success timer SHALL start, replacing any previous success timer
**AND** after 500ms without another matching receipt, a success toast SHALL be displayed with message "Draft saved in this browser", variant "success", and duration 1500ms

#### Scenario: Show error toast on failed write receipt

**GIVEN** the hook is mounted with an `AutoSaveIndicatorTarget`
**WHEN** a completed storage write receipt arrives for the derived draft storage key with status `failed`
**THEN** an error toast SHALL be displayed with message "Draft could not be saved in this browser" and variant "error"
**AND** any pending success timer SHALL be cleared

#### Scenario: Cleanup on unmount

**GIVEN** the hook is mounted and subscribed to storage write receipts
**WHEN** the component unmounts
**THEN** the receipt subscription SHALL be unsubscribed
**AND** any active success timer SHALL be cleared

### Requirement: Persisted State Hook

The system SHALL provide a `usePersistedState` hook that synchronizes React state with localStorage using JSON serialization.

**Source**: `src/hooks/usePersistedState.ts:19-66`

**Rationale**: UI preferences (sidebar collapse, panel expansion) should persist across sessions without requiring a database.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Load from localStorage on mount

**GIVEN** a value exists in localStorage for the specified key
**WHEN** the hook initializes
**THEN** the state SHALL be set to the parsed JSON value from localStorage

#### Scenario: Use default value when no stored data

**GIVEN** no value exists in localStorage for the specified key
**WHEN** the hook initializes
**THEN** the state SHALL be set to the provided default value

#### Scenario: Persist to localStorage on state change

**GIVEN** the state value changes
**WHEN** the hook is initialized (isInitialized = true)
**THEN** the new value SHALL be serialized to JSON and written to localStorage

#### Scenario: Support functional updates

**GIVEN** the setter is called with a function `(prev) => newValue`
**WHEN** the function is executed
**THEN** the previous state SHALL be passed to the function
**AND** the resolved value SHALL be set as the new state

#### Scenario: Handle localStorage read errors

**GIVEN** localStorage.getItem() throws an error (e.g., quota exceeded, disabled)
**WHEN** the hook attempts to read from localStorage
**THEN** a warning SHALL be logged via `logger.warn()`
**AND** the default value SHALL be used

#### Scenario: Handle localStorage write errors

**GIVEN** localStorage.setItem() throws an error (e.g., quota exceeded)
**WHEN** the hook attempts to write to localStorage
**THEN** a warning SHALL be logged via `logger.warn()`
**AND** the state SHALL remain updated in memory

### Requirement: Storage Keys

The system SHALL provide a `STORAGE_KEYS` constant object with predefined localStorage keys for UI preferences.

**Source**: `src/hooks/usePersistedState.ts:71-78`

**Rationale**: Centralized key management prevents typos and ensures consistent naming conventions.

**Priority**: Medium

#### Scenario: Sidebar collapsed state key

**GIVEN** the application needs to persist sidebar collapsed state
**WHEN** accessing `STORAGE_KEYS.SIDEBAR_COLLAPSED`
**THEN** the value SHALL be `'mekstation:sidebar-collapsed'`

#### Scenario: Loadout tray expanded state key

**GIVEN** the application needs to persist loadout tray expanded state (desktop)
**WHEN** accessing `STORAGE_KEYS.LOADOUT_TRAY_EXPANDED`
**THEN** the value SHALL be `'mekstation:loadout-tray-expanded'`

#### Scenario: Loadout sheet expanded state key

**GIVEN** the application needs to persist loadout bottom sheet expanded state (mobile)
**WHEN** accessing `STORAGE_KEYS.LOADOUT_SHEET_EXPANDED`
**THEN** the value SHALL be `'mekstation:loadout-sheet-expanded'`

### Requirement: Game State Persistence Hook

The system SHALL provide a `useGameStatePersistence` hook that autosaves game state to localStorage with configurable intervals, debouncing, conflict detection, and unsaved change warnings.

**Source**: `src/hooks/useGameStatePersistence.ts:useGameStatePersistence`

**Rationale**: Game sessions can be long and complex; autosave prevents data loss from browser crashes or accidental tab closures.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Autosave after debounce period

**GIVEN** the game state changes and `enableAutosave` is true
**WHEN** 1000ms (default debounce) elapse without further changes
**THEN** the state SHALL be saved to localStorage with metadata

#### Scenario: Periodic autosave

**GIVEN** the game state has unsaved changes and `enableAutosave` is true
**WHEN** 30000ms (default interval) elapse
**THEN** the state SHALL be saved to localStorage with metadata

#### Scenario: Manual save

**GIVEN** the game state is not null
**WHEN** the `save()` function is called
**THEN** the state SHALL be saved to localStorage with metadata
**AND** `isSaving` SHALL be true during the save operation
**AND** `hasUnsavedChanges` SHALL be set to false after save completes
**AND** `lastSaved` SHALL be updated to the current timestamp

#### Scenario: Load state on mount

**GIVEN** the hook initializes
**WHEN** the component mounts
**THEN** the `load()` function SHALL be called automatically
**AND** if stored data exists, the state SHALL be restored
**AND** if no stored data exists, the state SHALL be null

#### Scenario: Conflict detection on save

**GIVEN** the hook has loaded state with timestamp T1
**WHEN** the `save()` function is called
**AND** localStorage contains data with timestamp T2 > T1
**THEN** an error SHALL be thrown with message "Save conflict: Local storage has newer data than current state"
**AND** `error` SHALL be set to the conflict error
**AND** the save operation SHALL be aborted

#### Scenario: Beforeunload warning for unsaved changes

**GIVEN** the game state has unsaved changes (`hasUnsavedChanges` is true)
**WHEN** the user attempts to close the tab or navigate away
**THEN** a beforeunload event handler SHALL be registered
**AND** the browser SHALL display a confirmation dialog with message "You have unsaved changes. Are you sure you want to leave?"

#### Scenario: Clear saved data

**GIVEN** saved data exists in localStorage
**WHEN** the `clear()` function is called
**THEN** the data SHALL be removed from localStorage
**AND** the state SHALL be set to null
**AND** `lastSaved` SHALL be set to null
**AND** `hasUnsavedChanges` SHALL be set to false

#### Scenario: Update state with autosave trigger

**GIVEN** `enableAutosave` is true
**WHEN** the `setState()` function is called with new state
**THEN** the state SHALL be updated
**AND** `hasUnsavedChanges` SHALL be set to true
**AND** the debounce timer SHALL start

### Requirement: Save Metadata

The system SHALL store metadata alongside game state to enable versioning and conflict detection.

**Source**: `src/hooks/useGameStatePersistence.ts:22-38`

**Rationale**: Metadata enables conflict detection, schema migration, and debugging.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Save with metadata

**GIVEN** the `save()` function is called
**WHEN** the state is serialized to localStorage
**THEN** the stored data SHALL include a `metadata` object with:

- `timestamp`: current timestamp (Date.now())
- `version`: schema version string (default: '1.0.0')

#### Scenario: Internal timestamp for conflict detection

**GIVEN** the `save()` function is called
**WHEN** the state is serialized to localStorage
**THEN** the stored state SHALL include an internal `_lastSaved` timestamp
**AND** this timestamp SHALL be used for conflict detection on subsequent saves

---

### Requirement: Server-Side Persistence Contract

The auto-save persistence system SHALL define server-side persistence
behaviour in parallel to the client-side IndexedDB contract, so active
matches survive server restarts without data loss.

#### Scenario: Write-through on every append

- **GIVEN** a `ServerMatchHost` receiving an appendable event
- **WHEN** the host resolves the event
- **THEN** the event SHALL be persisted via `IMatchStore.appendEvent`
  BEFORE being broadcast to connected clients
- **AND** a failed persist SHALL prevent the broadcast and emit
  `Error {code: 'STORE_FAILURE'}`

#### Scenario: Load on server startup

- **GIVEN** the server has a set of matches with `status: 'active'` in
  the store at process startup
- **WHEN** the server initializes
- **THEN** it SHALL call `getEvents(matchId)` for each active match
- **AND** it SHALL instantiate `ServerMatchHost` instances pre-loaded
  with the retrieved event logs

#### Scenario: Match store API parity with client IndexedDB

- **GIVEN** the 4a client-side IndexedDB contract and this server-side
  `IMatchStore` contract
- **WHEN** both are inspected
- **THEN** both SHALL support ordered event retrieval by `(matchId,
fromSeq)`
- **AND** both SHALL enforce that a single match's events have no
  sequence gaps and no duplicate sequences

### Requirement: Cross-Device Reconnect Depends On Server Store

The system SHALL rely on the server-side `IMatchStore` (not the
client's IndexedDB) as the source of truth during reconnect for
networked matches, so a player reconnecting from a different device
receives the same authoritative log.

#### Scenario: Cross-device reconnect delivers same state

- **GIVEN** a player plays for 10 turns on Device A, then opens the
  match on Device B with a fresh IndexedDB
- **WHEN** Device B authenticates and sends `SessionJoin {lastSeq: 0}`
- **THEN** the server SHALL stream the full event log from the
  `IMatchStore`
- **AND** Device B's `currentState` SHALL match Device A's state at
  the last event

### Requirement: Game Event Log Storage

The auto-save persistence system SHALL provide an IndexedDB-backed
storage path for game event logs, keyed by match id and event sequence.

#### Scenario: Event log storage schema

- **GIVEN** the app initializes its IndexedDB
- **WHEN** the schema is inspected
- **THEN** an object store `matchEvents` SHALL exist
- **AND** records SHALL have shape `{matchId, sequence, event, savedAt}`
- **AND** the primary key SHALL be the tuple `[matchId, sequence]`

#### Scenario: Match metadata store

- **GIVEN** the same IndexedDB
- **WHEN** the schema is inspected
- **THEN** an object store `matches` SHALL exist
- **AND** records SHALL have shape `{matchId, hostPeerId, guestPeerId,
status, lastActivity}`

### Requirement: Multi-Session Local Storage

The system SHALL allow multiple concurrent match logs to coexist in
local storage so a completed match remains inspectable while a new one
begins.

#### Scenario: Two match logs coexist

- **GIVEN** match `sess_abc` is completed and its log is on disk
- **WHEN** a new match `sess_xyz` starts and appends events
- **THEN** both match logs SHALL be queryable by match id
- **AND** writes to `sess_xyz` SHALL NOT overwrite `sess_abc` records

#### Scenario: Query events for a specific match

- **GIVEN** multiple match logs in IndexedDB
- **WHEN** `getEventsForMatch('sess_abc')` is called
- **THEN** the result SHALL include only events whose `matchId` equals
  `'sess_abc'`
- **AND** results SHALL be returned in ascending sequence order

### Requirement: Batched Writes

The system SHALL batch event-log writes to minimize IndexedDB
transaction overhead during high-frequency event bursts (e.g., the
attack-resolution phase that emits many events in sequence).

#### Scenario: Burst writes share a transaction

- **GIVEN** 20 events are appended within a single animation frame
- **WHEN** the persistence layer flushes
- **THEN** the 20 writes SHALL share a single IndexedDB transaction
- **AND** the flush SHALL complete within 50ms on a baseline device

### Requirement: Local Interactive Match Recovery Round-Trip

The auto-save persistence system SHALL provide a complete, executable recover round-trip for local interactive matches. Every authoritative event appended by an `InteractiveSession` mutation, including launch, phase progression, movement, attacks, AI actions, lifecycle transitions, and future command collaborators, SHALL be mirrored to the IndexedDB match log in sequence order. The client read path SHALL rebuild a drivable session from that complete log, the launch path SHALL guarantee the log is recoverable before navigation, and a refresh or close of an active interactive match SHALL never lose the match silently.

#### Scenario: Launch persists a recoverable log before navigation

- **GIVEN** an interactive match is launched and the UI is about to navigate to `/gameplay/games/<id>`
- **WHEN** the launch handshake completes
- **THEN** the match-log store SHALL contain a non-empty event log for `<id>` beginning with `GameCreated`, flushed before navigation
- **AND** a match-metadata row SHALL be upserted for `<id>`
- **AND** a hydrate immediately after navigation SHALL find the log.

#### Scenario: Authoritative post-launch events are mirrored

- **GIVEN** a launched interactive match whose initial events are present in IndexedDB
- **WHEN** the session commits one or more authoritative phase, movement, attack, AI, or lifecycle events
- **THEN** every newly appended event SHALL be enqueued for the same match id exactly once
- **AND** the persisted event sequence and type order SHALL equal the live session's appended event suffix
- **AND** an event-free session replacement SHALL NOT create a synthetic persistence record.

#### Scenario: Reload recovers the persisted log into equal state

- **GIVEN** an interactive match that progressed through a phase and appended movement or attack events after launch
- **AND** the raw IndexedDB match log contains those events in the same sequence and type order as the live session
- **WHEN** the page is reloaded with a fresh store and a fresh storage handle over the same persisted data and the session is loaded by id
- **THEN** the recovered session's events and `currentState` SHALL equal the pre-reload authoritative session
- **AND** the recovered session SHALL remain in the same phase and activation position
- **AND** the recovered session SHALL be drivable and accept a further legal move or attack, not become a read-only replay.

#### Scenario: Refresh-loss warning safety net on an active interactive match

- **GIVEN** an interactive `InteractiveSession` is the active store session and the match is not `Completed`
- **WHEN** the player attempts to refresh, close the tab, or navigate away
- **THEN** a `beforeunload` guard SHALL warn the player that leaving interrupts the live match
- **AND** the guard SHALL apply even in the narrow window before the first event flush or when IndexedDB is unavailable, so the reload is never silently destructive
- **AND** the guard SHALL NOT be registered for the demo session, spectator playback, a completed match, or when there is no active session.

#### Scenario: Unavailable storage degrades without crashing

- **GIVEN** the match-log store is unavailable due to private-mode or quota blocking
- **WHEN** an authoritative interactive match mutation appends an event
- **THEN** the command SHALL not crash and the match SHALL still run in memory
- **AND** match-log divergence SHALL be surfaced through the existing non-crashing error path
- **AND** a later reload SHALL surface a non-crashing "could not recover" error rather than an unhandled rejection
- **AND** the refresh-loss warning SHALL still have protected the player at unload time.

## Data Model Requirements

### Required Interfaces

The implementation MUST provide the following TypeScript interfaces:

```typescript
/**
 * Game state for persistence
 * Stores the current unit and editor state
 */
interface GameState {
  /**
   * Currently active unit being edited
   */
  readonly currentUnit?: IBattleMech;

  /**
   * List of recently edited units (references by ID)
   */
  readonly recentUnitIds?: string[];

  /**
   * Editor UI state that should be preserved
   */
  readonly editorState?: {
    readonly activeTab?: string;
    readonly selectedLocation?: string;
    readonly panelState?: Record<string, boolean>;
  };
}

/**
 * Save metadata for versioning and conflict detection
 */
interface SaveMetadata {
  /**
   * Timestamp when the save occurred
   */
  readonly timestamp: number;

  /**
   * Schema version for migration support
   */
  readonly version: string;
}

/**
 * Complete stored data structure
 */
interface StoredData {
  /**
   * Game state with internal metadata
   */
  readonly state: GameState & { _lastSaved?: number };

  /**
   * Save metadata
   */
  readonly metadata: SaveMetadata;
}

/**
 * Options for useGameStatePersistence hook
 */
interface UseGameStatePersistenceOptions {
  /**
   * Key to use for localStorage
   */
  readonly storageKey: string;

  /**
   * Autosave interval in milliseconds (default: 30000 = 30 seconds)
   */
  readonly autosaveInterval?: number;

  /**
   * Debounce delay in milliseconds before autosave after state change (default: 1000)
   */
  readonly autosaveDebounce?: number;

  /**
   * Enable/disable autosave (default: true)
   */
  readonly enableAutosave?: boolean;

  /**
   * Version of the game state schema (for migration)
   */
  readonly version?: string;
}

/**
 * Return value from useGameStatePersistence hook
 */
interface UseGameStatePersistenceReturn {
  /**
   * Current game state
   */
  readonly state: GameState | null;

  /**
   * Whether state is currently being saved
   */
  readonly isSaving: boolean;

  /**
   * Whether there are unsaved changes
   */
  readonly hasUnsavedChanges: boolean;

  /**
   * Last saved timestamp (null if never saved)
   */
  readonly lastSaved: Date | null;

  /**
   * Error from last save/load operation (null if no error)
   */
  readonly error: Error | null;

  /**
   * Save state manually
   */
  readonly save: () => Promise<void>;

  /**
   * Load state from storage
   */
  readonly load: () => Promise<void>;

  /**
   * Clear all saved data
   */
  readonly clear: () => void;

  /**
   * Update game state (triggers autosave if enabled)
   */
  readonly setState: (state: GameState) => void;
}
```

### Required Constants

The implementation MUST provide the following constants:

```typescript
/**
 * Storage keys for MekStation UI preferences
 */
const STORAGE_KEYS = {
  /** Main navigation sidebar collapsed state */
  SIDEBAR_COLLAPSED: 'mekstation:sidebar-collapsed',
  /** Equipment loadout tray expanded state (desktop) */
  LOADOUT_TRAY_EXPANDED: 'mekstation:loadout-tray-expanded',
  /** Equipment loadout bottom sheet expanded (mobile) */
  LOADOUT_SHEET_EXPANDED: 'mekstation:loadout-sheet-expanded',
} as const;

/**
 * Default autosave interval (30 seconds)
 */
const DEFAULT_AUTOSAVE_INTERVAL = 30000;

/**
 * Default autosave debounce delay (1 second)
 */
const DEFAULT_AUTOSAVE_DEBOUNCE = 1000;

/**
 * Default schema version
 */
const DEFAULT_VERSION = '1.0.0';
```

### Type Constraints

- `storageKey` MUST be a non-empty string
- `autosaveInterval` MUST be a positive number (if provided)
- `autosaveDebounce` MUST be a positive number (if provided)
- `version` MUST follow semantic versioning format (if provided)
- `GameState` MAY be null (no active game session)
- `_lastSaved` MUST NOT be exposed in the public API (internal use only)

---

## Dependencies

### Depends On

- **toast-notifications**: `useToast` hook for displaying save feedback
- **client-safe-storage**: `subscribeToStorageWriteReceipts` for completed customizer-draft write receipts used by `useAutoSaveIndicator`
- **logger**: `logger.warn()` for logging localStorage errors

### Used By

- **unit-builder**: Uses `useAutoSaveIndicator` to show save feedback
- **game-session-management**: Uses `useGameStatePersistence` for session autosave
- **app-navigation**: Uses `usePersistedState` for sidebar and panel state
- **equipment-browser**: Uses `usePersistedState` for loadout tray/sheet state

---

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations

- **Receipt-driven indicator**: `useAutoSaveIndicator` toasts from completed storage write receipts for the target draft key; a 500ms success timer collapses rapid saved receipts, and failed receipts emit an error toast immediately
- **Autosave debouncing**: Game state autosave debounces for 1000ms to reduce localStorage writes
- **Periodic autosave**: Game state autosave runs every 30 seconds (configurable) as a safety net
- **JSON serialization**: All persisted state uses JSON.stringify/parse, which can be slow for large objects
- **localStorage quota**: Browser localStorage is typically limited to 5-10MB; large game states may exceed this

### Edge Cases

- **SSR/SSG**: `usePersistedState` checks `typeof window === 'undefined'` to avoid errors during server-side rendering
- **localStorage disabled**: All hooks handle localStorage errors gracefully by logging warnings and falling back to in-memory state
- **Quota exceeded**: Write errors are logged but do not crash the application
- **Concurrent saves**: `useGameStatePersistence` detects conflicts by comparing timestamps and throws an error to prevent data loss
- **Unmount during save**: Cleanup functions clear timers and unsubscribe from stores to prevent memory leaks

### Common Pitfalls

- **Pitfall**: Forgetting to initialize `usePersistedState` before first render
  - **Solution**: Hook uses `isInitialized` flag to prevent writing default value to localStorage before reading existing value

- **Pitfall**: Storing non-serializable data (functions, circular references) in persisted state
  - **Solution**: JSON.stringify will throw an error; use only plain objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, and null

- **Pitfall**: Using `useAutoSaveIndicator` without `ToastProvider` in the component tree
  - **Solution**: Ensure `ToastProvider` wraps the component using the hook

- **Pitfall**: Conflict detection false positives when multiple tabs are open
  - **Solution**: Current implementation does not support multi-tab synchronization; consider using BroadcastChannel or storage events for cross-tab sync

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Auto-Save Indicator

**Usage**:

```typescript
import { useAutoSaveIndicator } from '@/hooks/useAutoSaveIndicator';
import { UnitType } from '@/types/unit/BattleMechInterfaces';

function UnitBuilder({ unitId }: { unitId: string }) {
  useAutoSaveIndicator({ unitId, unitType: UnitType.BATTLEMECH });

  return <div>Unit Builder UI</div>;
}
```

**Behavior**:

1. Hook derives the customizer draft storage key from `AutoSaveIndicatorTarget`
2. Hook subscribes to completed storage write receipts for that key
3. A matching `saved` receipt starts a 500ms success timer, then toasts "Draft saved in this browser" (success, 1500ms duration)
4. A matching `failed` receipt toasts "Draft could not be saved in this browser" (error) and clears any pending success timer
5. Unmount unsubscribes from receipts and clears the success timer

### Example 2: Persisted State for Sidebar

**Usage**:

```typescript
import { usePersistedState, STORAGE_KEYS } from '@/hooks/usePersistedState';

function Sidebar() {
  const [isCollapsed, setIsCollapsed] = usePersistedState(
    STORAGE_KEYS.SIDEBAR_COLLAPSED,
    false // default: expanded
  );

  return (
    <aside className={isCollapsed ? 'w-16' : 'w-64'}>
      <button onClick={() => setIsCollapsed(!isCollapsed)}>
        Toggle
      </button>
    </aside>
  );
}
```

**Behavior**:

1. On mount, hook reads `localStorage.getItem('mekstation:sidebar-collapsed')`
2. If value exists, state is set to parsed JSON value (true/false)
3. If no value exists, state is set to default (false)
4. When user clicks toggle, `setIsCollapsed` updates state and writes to localStorage
5. On next page load, sidebar restores previous collapsed state

### Example 3: Game State Persistence

**Usage**:

```typescript
import { useGameStatePersistence } from '@/hooks/useGameStatePersistence';

function GameSession() {
  const {
    state,
    isSaving,
    hasUnsavedChanges,
    lastSaved,
    error,
    save,
    load,
    clear,
    setState,
  } = useGameStatePersistence({
    storageKey: 'mekstation-game-session',
    autosaveInterval: 30000, // 30 seconds
    autosaveDebounce: 1000,  // 1 second
    enableAutosave: true,
    version: '1.0.0',
  });

  const handleUnitChange = (unit: IBattleMech) => {
    setState({
      ...state,
      currentUnit: unit,
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {hasUnsavedChanges && <span>Unsaved changes</span>}
      {lastSaved && <span>Last saved: {lastSaved.toLocaleTimeString()}</span>}
      {error && <span>Error: {error.message}</span>}
      <button onClick={save} disabled={isSaving}>
        Save Now
      </button>
      <button onClick={clear}>Clear Save</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Behavior**:

1. On mount, hook calls `load()` and restores state from localStorage (if exists)
2. User edits unit, triggering `handleUnitChange`
3. `setState` updates state and sets `hasUnsavedChanges = true`
4. Debounce timer starts (1000ms)
5. If no further changes within 1000ms, autosave triggers
6. State is saved to localStorage with metadata (timestamp, version)
7. `hasUnsavedChanges` is set to false, `lastSaved` is updated
8. If user tries to close tab with unsaved changes, browser shows confirmation dialog
9. Periodic autosave runs every 30 seconds as a safety net
