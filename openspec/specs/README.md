## Development Workflow

### Creating New Specs
1. Use templates in `openspec/templates/`
2. Follow GIVEN/WHEN/THEN scenario format
3. Define complete TypeScript interfaces
4. Include comprehensive examples
5. Document dependencies clearly

### Updating Existing Specs
1. Update version number in header
2. Add changelog entry at bottom
3. Update dependent specs if interfaces change
4. Maintain backwards compatibility when possible

### Validation
- Follow spec-template.md structure exactly
- Include all required sections
- Provide testable scenarios
- Reference official BattleTech rules

## Contributing

When adding new specifications:
1. Determine which phase it belongs to
2. Create directory: `phase-N-category/system-name/`
3. Create `spec.md` following template
4. Update this README with entry
5. Update dependent specs with new dependency
