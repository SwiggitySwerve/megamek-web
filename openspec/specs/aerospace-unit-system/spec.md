## Overview

### Purpose

The aerospace unit system defines the construction, state management, BLK format handling, validation, and customizer UI for aerospace fighters, conventional fighters, and small craft in MekStation. It enables users to create, configure, and validate aerospace units following BattleTech TechManual rules.

### Scope

**In Scope:**

- Aerospace fighter (ASF), conventional fighter, and small craft data models and interfaces
- Aerospace state shape and Zustand store implementation
- BLK format parsing and serialization for aerospace units
- Customizer UI workflow (Structure, Armor, Equipment tabs with diagram and status bar)
- Validation rules for aerospace construction (VAL-AERO-_ and AERO-_ rule sets)
- Armor allocation by firing arc (Nose, Left Wing, Right Wing, Aft)
- Equipment mounting by firing arc with fuselage support
- Weight class classification, engine/thrust relationships, and fuel management
- Tech base variants (Inner Sphere, Clan) and cockpit types

**Out of Scope:**

- Combat mechanics for aerospace units are OUT OF SCOPE — see future aerospace-combat-system spec
- DropShip, JumpShip, WarShip, and Space Station construction details (these share some base interfaces but have distinct construction rules)
- Record sheet PDF export for aerospace units
- Campaign-level aerospace operations and maintenance
- Atmospheric flight rules and terrain interaction

### Key Concepts

- **Aerospace Fighter (ASF)**: A fusion-powered combat spacecraft weighing 5–100 tons with thrust-based movement, four armor arcs, and equipment mounted by firing arc
- **Conventional Fighter**: A non-fusion-powered atmospheric combat aircraft sharing the same structural model as ASF but with different engine types (ICE, Fuel Cell, etc.)
- **Small Craft**: Spacecraft of 100–200 tons with crew, cargo, and passenger capacity; uses side locations instead of wing locations
- **Firing Arc**: One of four directional zones (Nose, Left Wing, Right Wing, Aft) plus an internal Fuselage location where equipment is mounted
- **Safe Thrust / Max Thrust**: Movement ratings where Max Thrust = floor(Safe Thrust × 1.5)
- **Structural Integrity (SI)**: A durability rating representing the aerospace unit's structural resilience; default = ceil(tonnage / 10)
- **OmniFighter**: An aerospace fighter with pod-mounted equipment that can be swapped between missions

## Requirements

### Requirement: Unit Type Classification

The system SHALL support three aerospace unit types: Aerospace Fighter, Conventional Fighter, and Small Craft, each with distinct interfaces extending a common `IAerospaceUnit` base.

**Rationale**: BattleTech defines distinct aerospace unit categories with shared movement/armor systems but different construction constraints.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Creating an Aerospace Fighter

**GIVEN** a user initiates creation of a new aerospace unit
**WHEN** the unit type is set to `UnitType.AEROSPACE`
**THEN** the system SHALL create an `IAerospace` instance
**AND** the motion type SHALL be `AerospaceMotionType.AERODYNE`
**AND** the unit SHALL have `armorByArc` with nose, leftWing, rightWing, and aft fields
**AND** the unit SHALL support `IAerospaceMountedEquipment` for equipment

#### Scenario: Creating a Conventional Fighter

**GIVEN** a user initiates creation of a conventional fighter
**WHEN** the unit type is set to `UnitType.CONVENTIONAL_FIGHTER`
**THEN** the system SHALL create an `IConventionalFighter` instance
**AND** the motion type SHALL be `AerospaceMotionType.AERODYNE`
**AND** the unit SHALL have a `conventionalEngineType` field (ICE, Fuel Cell, Electric, MagLev, Solar, Fission, Fusion)

#### Scenario: Creating a Small Craft

**GIVEN** a user initiates creation of a small craft
**WHEN** the unit type is set to `UnitType.SMALL_CRAFT`
**THEN** the system SHALL create an `ISmallCraft` instance
**AND** the motion type MAY be either `AERODYNE` or `SPHEROID`
**AND** the unit SHALL have `armorByArc` with nose, leftSide, rightSide, and aft fields
**AND** the unit SHALL track crew, passengers, cargoCapacity, escapePods, and lifeBoats

### Requirement: Tonnage and Weight Class

The system SHALL enforce tonnage ranges and derive weight classes for aerospace units.

**Rationale**: BattleTech defines specific tonnage ranges for aerospace fighters with weight class thresholds.

**Priority**: Critical

#### Scenario: Valid ASF tonnage range

**GIVEN** an aerospace fighter
**WHEN** setting tonnage
**THEN** tonnage MUST be between 5 and 100 tons inclusive
**AND** tonnage SHALL be selectable in 5-ton increments (5, 10, 15, ... 100)

#### Scenario: Weight class derivation for store state

**GIVEN** an aerospace fighter in the customizer store
**WHEN** tonnage is set
**THEN** weight class SHALL be derived as:

- Light: tonnage ≤ 19
- Medium: tonnage 20–39
- Heavy: tonnage 40–69
- Assault: tonnage ≥ 70

#### Scenario: Weight class derivation for BLK handler

**GIVEN** an aerospace fighter parsed from BLK format
**WHEN** weight class is calculated
**THEN** weight class SHALL be derived as:

- Light: tonnage ≤ 45
- Medium: tonnage 46–70
- Heavy: tonnage > 70

#### Scenario: Tonnage change recalculates engine rating

**GIVEN** an aerospace fighter with safe thrust T
**WHEN** tonnage is changed to a new value N
**THEN** engine rating SHALL be recalculated as N × T
**AND** engine rating SHALL be clamped to range [10, 400]
**AND** structural integrity SHALL be recalculated as ceil(N / 10)

### Requirement: Engine and Thrust Configuration

The system SHALL support engine type selection and thrust-based movement for aerospace fighters.

**Rationale**: Aerospace fighters use thrust ratings rather than walk/run MP, with engine rating derived from tonnage × safe thrust.

**Priority**: Critical

**GIVEN** an aerospace fighter in the customizer
**WHEN** selecting an engine type
**THEN** the following engine types SHALL be available: Standard Fusion, XL Engine (IS), XL Engine (Clan), Light Engine, Compact Engine

## Calculation Formulas

### Engine Rating

**Formula**:

```
engineRating = tonnage × safeThrust
```

**Where**:

- `tonnage` = unit mass in tons (5–100)
- `safeThrust` = safe thrust rating (1–12)

**Example**:

```
Input: tonnage = 50, safeThrust = 6
Calculation: engineRating = 50 × 6
Output: engineRating = 300
```

**Special Cases**:

- When tonnage changes, engine rating is recalculated to maintain the same safe thrust
- Engine rating is clamped to [10, 400]

### Max Thrust

**Formula**:

```
maxThrust = floor(safeThrust × 1.5)
```

**Example**:

```
Input: safeThrust = 5
Calculation: maxThrust = floor(5 × 1.5) = floor(7.5)
Output: maxThrust = 7
```

### Armor Auto-Allocation

**Formula**:

```
totalPoints = floor(armorTonnage × pointsPerTon)
nose     = floor(totalPoints × 0.35)
leftWing = floor(totalPoints × 0.25)
rightWing = floor(totalPoints × 0.25)
aft      = floor(totalPoints × 0.15)
```

**Where**:

- `armorTonnage` = tons of armor allocated
- `pointsPerTon` = armor type's points-per-ton ratio (default 16 for Standard)

**Example**:

```
Input: armorTonnage = 10, armorType = Standard (16 pts/ton)
Calculation: totalPoints = 160
  nose = floor(160 × 0.35) = 56
  leftWing = floor(160 × 0.25) = 40
  rightWing = floor(160 × 0.25) = 40
  aft = floor(160 × 0.15) = 24
Output: { nose: 56, leftWing: 40, rightWing: 40, aft: 24 }
```

### Maximum Armor Per Arc

**Formula**:

```
baseArmor = floor(tonnage × 0.8)
maxNose      = floor(baseArmor × 0.35)
maxLeftWing  = floor(baseArmor × 0.25)
maxRightWing = floor(baseArmor × 0.25)
maxAft       = floor(baseArmor × 0.15)
```

**Example**:

```
Input: tonnage = 50
Calculation: baseArmor = floor(50 × 0.8) = 40
  maxNose = floor(40 × 0.35) = 14
  maxWing = floor(40 × 0.25) = 10
  maxAft  = floor(40 × 0.15) = 6
Output: { nose: 14, wing: 10, aft: 6 }
```

### Simplified Weight Calculation (Handler)

**Formula**:

```
weight = engineWeight + structureWeight + armorWeight + heatSinkWeight + fuelWeight + cockpitWeight
```

**Where**:

- `engineWeight` = (safeThrust × tonnage) × 0.05
- `structureWeight` = tonnage × 0.1
- `armorWeight` = totalArmorPoints / 16
- `heatSinkWeight` = max(0, heatSinks - 10) × 1
- `fuelWeight` = fuel / 200
- `cockpitWeight` = 3

### Simplified BV Calculation (Handler)

**Formula**:

```
baseBV = (totalArmorPoints × 2) + (structuralIntegrity × 10)
thrustMod = 1 + (safeThrust - 5) × 0.05
bv = round(baseBV × thrustMod)
```

**Example**:

```
Input: totalArmorPoints = 96, SI = 8, safeThrust = 5
Calculation: baseBV = (96 × 2) + (8 × 10) = 272
  thrustMod = 1 + (5 - 5) × 0.05 = 1.0
  bv = round(272 × 1.0) = 272
Output: bv = 272
```

### Simplified Cost Calculation (Handler)

**Formula**:

```
cost = (tonnage × 50000) + (thrustRating × 10000) + (totalArmorPoints × 10000) + 200000
```

**Where**:

- `thrustRating` = safeThrust × tonnage

## Tech Base Variants

### Inner Sphere Implementation

**Differences from base specification**:

- Engine options: Standard Fusion, XL Engine (IS), Light Engine, Compact Engine
- Armor options: Standard, Ferro-Fibrous (IS), Light Ferro-Fibrous, Heavy Ferro-Fibrous, Stealth

**Special Rules**:

- Tech base is parsed from BLK type string; strings containing "clan" (without "mixed") map to Clan, all others to Inner Sphere
- Rules level is inferred from BLK type string keywords: "level 1"/"introductory" → Introductory, "level 2"/"standard" → Standard, "level 3"/"advanced" → Advanced, "level 4"/"experimental" → Experimental

### Clan Implementation

**Differences from base specification**:

- Engine options: Standard Fusion, XL Engine (Clan)
- Armor options: Standard, Ferro-Fibrous (Clan)

**Special Rules**:

- Clan XL engines use fewer critical slots than IS XL
- Clan Ferro-Fibrous armor provides 19.2 points per ton vs IS 17.92

### Mixed Tech Rules

**When unit tech base is Mixed**:

- The customizer SHALL display both IS and Clan engine and armor options
- Tech base is determined at unit creation and is read-only in the customizer
- The BLK parser defaults to Inner Sphere when tech base string does not explicitly contain "clan"

## BLK Format Integration


---

## Customizer UI Workflow


---

## State Management


---

## Dependencies

### Depends On

- **engine-system**: Engine type definitions and weight multipliers used in status bar weight calculations
- **armor-system**: Armor type definitions, points-per-ton ratios for armor allocation and display
- **construction-rules-core**: Overall construction validation framework
- **unit-entity-model**: Base `IBaseUnit` interface that `IAerospaceUnit` extends
- **equipment-database**: Equipment item definitions used by the equipment browser
- **unit-validation-framework**: Validation rule interfaces (`IUnitValidationRuleDefinition`, severity levels, result factories)

### Used By

- **serialization-formats**: BLK format handling for aerospace units
- **customizer-tabs**: Aerospace customizer integrates into the main customizer tab system
- **unit-store-architecture**: Aerospace store follows the unit store registry pattern

### Construction Sequence

1. Create aerospace unit with tonnage, tech base, and unit type selection
2. Configure engine type and thrust (auto-calculates engine rating)
3. Set structural integrity, cockpit type, and heat sinks
4. Allocate armor type, tonnage, and per-arc distribution
5. Mount equipment by firing arc
6. Validate construction rules
7. Save/export unit

---

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations

- Store selectors are used individually per field to minimize React re-renders
- Armor allocation calculations use `useMemo` for derived values
- Equipment list operations (add, remove, arc change) create new arrays for immutable state updates

### Edge Cases

- **Zero armor tonnage**: Auto-allocate SHALL produce all-zero allocations
- **Tonnage change with existing equipment**: Equipment is NOT cleared when tonnage changes
- **Generic "wings" location**: BLK files using generic "wings" location string SHALL map to LEFT_WING
- **Missing BLK fields**: Parser uses fallback defaults (safeThrust: 0, fuel: 0, heatsinks: 10, cockpitType: Standard)
- **Ejection seat default**: Defaults to `true` in both new unit creation and BLK parsing when not explicitly specified

### Common Pitfalls

- **Pitfall**: Setting maxThrust independently from safeThrust
  - **Solution**: maxThrust is always derived via `floor(safeThrust × 1.5)` and MUST NOT be set directly
- **Pitfall**: Forgetting to update name when chassis or model changes
  - **Solution**: `setChassis` and `setModel` actions automatically recompute `name` as `"{chassis} {model}"`
- **Pitfall**: Over-allocating armor points beyond available
  - **Solution**: UI displays unallocated count with color-coded warnings; validation catches over-allocation
