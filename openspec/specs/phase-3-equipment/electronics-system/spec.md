---

## Calculation Formulas

### Targeting Computer Weight and Slots

**Formula**:
```
For Inner Sphere:
  weight = ceiling(mechTonnage / 4)
  criticalSlots = ceiling(mechTonnage / 4)

For Clan:
  weight = ceiling(mechTonnage / 5)
  criticalSlots = ceiling(mechTonnage / 5)
```

**Where**:
- `mechTonnage` = total tonnage of the BattleMech
- `ceiling()` = round up to nearest integer

**Example**:
```
Input: 65-ton BattleMech, Inner Sphere
Calculation:
  weight = ceiling(65 / 4) = ceiling(16.25) = 17 tons
  criticalSlots = ceiling(65 / 4) = 17 slots
Output: Targeting Computer weighs 17 tons, requires 17 slots
```

**Special Cases**:
- Minimum weight/slots: 1 (for mechs under 4 tons for IS, 5 tons for Clan - theoretical only)
- Maximum practical: 25 tons/slots (100-ton mech with IS TC)

### MASC Weight and Slots

**Formula**:
```
weight = mechTonnage × 0.05
criticalSlots = ceiling(weight)
minimum criticalSlots = 1
```

**Where**:
- `mechTonnage` = total tonnage of the BattleMech
- Weight is exact (may be fractional)
- Slots are always integer (rounded up)

**Example**:
```
Input: 55-ton BattleMech
Calculation:
  weight = 55 × 0.05 = 2.75 tons
  criticalSlots = ceiling(2.75) = 3 slots
Output: MASC weighs 2.75 tons, requires 3 slots
```

**Special Cases**:
- Minimum: 1 ton, 1 slot (20-ton mech)
- Maximum: 5 tons, 5 slots (100-ton mech)

### Supercharger Weight

**Formula**:
```
weight = engineRating / 10
criticalSlots = 1 (always)
```

**Where**:
- `engineRating` = engine rating number

**Example**:
```
Input: Engine Rating 300
Calculation:
  weight = 300 / 10 = 30 tons
  criticalSlots = 1
Output: Supercharger weighs 30 tons, requires 1 slot
```

**Special Cases**:
- Result may be fractional (e.g., 175 rating = 17.5 tons)
- Always exactly 1 critical slot regardless of weight

**Rounding Rules**:
- Targeting Computer: Always round UP (ceiling function)
- MASC weight: No rounding (exact fractional tons)
- MASC slots: Round UP (ceiling function)
- Supercharger weight: No rounding (exact fractional tons)

## Tech Base Variants

### Inner Sphere Implementation

**Differences from base specification**:
- Targeting Computer: `weight = ceiling(tonnage / 4)`, `slots = ceiling(tonnage / 4)`
- Guardian ECM Suite: 1.5 tons, 2 slots, 6 hex range
- Beagle Active Probe: 1.5 tons, 2 slots, 4 hex range
- Bloodhound Active Probe: 2 tons, 3 slots, 8 hex range
- C3 Master: 5 tons, 5 slots, supports 3 slaves
- C3 Slave: 1 ton, 1 slot
- C3i Computer: 2.5 tons, 2 slots
- MASC (IS): Same weight formula, may have different introduction year

**Special Rules**:
- Artemis V and Apollo FCS are Inner Sphere exclusive
- C3 systems (Master/Slave/C3i) are Inner Sphere exclusive
- Guardian ECM is Inner Sphere only (Clan has standard ECM)

**Example**:
```typescript
const guardianECM: IECM = {
  id: 'ecm-guardian-is',
  name: 'Guardian ECM Suite',
  techBase: TechBase.INNER_SPHERE,
  rulesLevel: RulesLevel.STANDARD,
  category: ElectronicsCategory.ELECTRONIC_WARFARE,
  weight: 1.5,
  criticalSlots: 2,
  effectRange: 6,
  jamsC3: true,
  isEnhanced: false,
  locationRestrictions: [LocationRestriction.NO_HEAD]
};
```

### Clan Implementation

**Differences from base specification**:
- Targeting Computer: `weight = ceiling(tonnage / 5)`, `slots = ceiling(tonnage / 5)` (more efficient)
- ECM Suite (Clan): 1 ton, 1 slot, 6 hex range
- Active Probe (Clan): 1 ton, 1 slot, 5 hex range (better than Beagle)
- C3 Boosted System: 3 tons, 2 slots, Clan exclusive
- MASC (Clan): Same weight formula, different introduction year

**Special Rules**:
- Clan electronics are typically lighter and require fewer slots
- Clan Active Probe has 5 hex range vs Beagle's 4 hex
- C3 Boosted is Clan exclusive (but Clan doesn't have Master/Slave/C3i)

**Example**:
```typescript
const clanECM: IECM = {
  id: 'ecm-clan',
  name: 'ECM Suite',
  techBase: TechBase.CLAN,
  rulesLevel: RulesLevel.STANDARD,
  category: ElectronicsCategory.ELECTRONIC_WARFARE,
  weight: 1,
  criticalSlots: 1,
  effectRange: 6,
  jamsC3: true,
  isEnhanced: false,
  locationRestrictions: [LocationRestriction.NO_HEAD]
};
```

### Mixed Tech Rules

**When unit tech base is Mixed**:
- Unit may equip electronics from either tech base
- Targeting Computer tech base determines weight/slot formula used
- Cannot mix C3 systems from different tech bases in same network
- ECM and Active Probe can be mixed freely
- Tech base compatibility rules apply to all electronics
- Each electronics piece maintains its original tech base classification

---

## Dependencies

### Depends On
- **Core Entity Types**: IEntity, ITechBaseEntity, IPlaceableComponent, IValuedComponent, ITemporalEntity, IDocumentedEntity
- **Core Enumerations**: TechBase, RulesLevel, Era
- **Tech Base Integration**: Tech base locking rules, compatibility validation
- **Critical Slot Allocation**: Slot placement, location constraints
- **Engine System** (for Supercharger weight calculation): Engine rating access

### Used By
- **Equipment Configuration**: Electronics selection and configuration
- **Unit Validation**: Mutual exclusivity checks, location validation
- **Critical Slot Allocation**: Slot assignment for electronics
- **Weight Calculation**: Total equipment weight budget
- **Tech Base Validation**: Tech base locking based on electronics choices

### Construction Sequence
1. Define core enumerations (TechBase, RulesLevel, Era)
2. Define base entity interfaces (IEntity, ITechBaseEntity, etc.)
3. Define electronics interfaces and enumerations (this spec)
4. Validate location restrictions during placement
5. Calculate electronics weight contributions
6. Validate mutual exclusivity rules
7. Verify critical slot allocation
8. Check tech base compatibility

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Cache Targeting Computer weight/slot calculations based on mech tonnage
- Validate mutual exclusivity only when electronics are added/removed
- Location restriction checks can be performed at UI level before validation
- Electronics filtering by tech base should use indexed lookups

### Edge Cases
- **Fractional weights**: MASC and Supercharger can have fractional weights (store as exact decimal)
- **Zero-weight electronics**: None exist, all electronics have weight >= 1 ton
- **Head placement**: Only general prohibition is for ECM; most electronics avoid Head due to limited slots (6)
- **Targeting Computer size**: On very heavy mechs (80-100 tons), TC becomes very large and may not fit
- **C3 networks**: Network functionality requires multiple units; single unit validation only checks component limits
- **TSM interaction**: TSM is part of internal structure, not electronics, but affects MASC compatibility

### Common Pitfalls
- **Pitfall**: Forgetting to validate Targeting Computer location (torso only)
  - **Solution**: Always check location restrictions in placement validation
- **Pitfall**: Allowing multiple C3 systems on same unit
  - **Solution**: Enforce single C3 system rule in validation
- **Pitfall**: Not recalculating Targeting Computer weight when mech tonnage changes
  - **Solution**: Trigger recalculation on tonnage change, show warning if TC no longer fits
- **Pitfall**: Using integer division for Supercharger weight
  - **Solution**: Store exact fractional weight (e.g., 17.5 tons for rating 175)
- **Pitfall**: Forgetting tech base exclusive equipment (Artemis V, C3i, etc.)
  - **Solution**: Filter electronics by tech base before displaying in selection UI

## Examples

### Example 1: Guardian ECM Suite

**Input**:
```typescript
const guardianECM: IECM = {
  id: 'ecm-guardian-is',
  name: 'Guardian ECM Suite',
  techBase: TechBase.INNER_SPHERE,
  rulesLevel: RulesLevel.STANDARD,
  category: ElectronicsCategory.ELECTRONIC_WARFARE,
  functionality: 'Jams enemy targeting and communications within 6 hex radius',
  weight: 1.5,
  criticalSlots: 2,
  cost: 200000,
  battleValue: 61,
  effectRange: 6,
  jamsC3: true,
  isEnhanced: false,
  locationRestrictions: [LocationRestriction.NO_HEAD],
  introductionYear: 3045,
  era: Era.CLAN_INVASION,
  sourceBook: 'TechManual',
  pageReference: 213
};
```

**Processing**:
```typescript
// Validate placement
if (selectedLocation === MechLocation.HEAD) {
  throw new ValidationError('ECM cannot be placed in Head location');
}

// Allocate slots in selected location (e.g., Left Torso)
allocateSlots(MechLocation.LEFT_TORSO, guardianECM, 2);
```

**Output**:
```typescript
// Guardian ECM successfully placed in Left Torso
// Slots 1-2 occupied
// Weight: 1.5 tons allocated to equipment budget
// ECM provides 6 hex jamming radius during combat
```

### Example 2: Targeting Computer for 75-ton Mech (IS)

**Input**:
```typescript
const mechTonnage = 75;
const techBase = TechBase.INNER_SPHERE;
```

**Processing**:
```typescript
// Calculate TC requirements
const divisor = techBase === TechBase.INNER_SPHERE ? 4 : 5;
const tcWeight = Math.ceil(mechTonnage / divisor);
const tcSlots = Math.ceil(mechTonnage / divisor);

const targetingComputer: ITargetingComputer = {
  id: 'tc-is-75ton',
  name: 'Targeting Computer',
  techBase: TechBase.INNER_SPHERE,
  rulesLevel: RulesLevel.STANDARD,
  category: ElectronicsCategory.TARGETING,
  functionality: 'Provides accuracy bonus to direct-fire weapons',
  weight: tcWeight, // 19 tons
  criticalSlots: tcSlots, // 19 slots
  accuracyBonus: -1, // -1 to-hit modifier (better accuracy)
  affectsEnergy: true,
  affectsBallistic: true,
  affectsMissile: true,
  locationRestrictions: [LocationRestriction.TORSO_ONLY]
};
```

**Output**:
```typescript
// Targeting Computer: 19 tons, 19 slots
// Must be placed in CT, LT, or RT
// Likely requires split placement across multiple torso locations
// Example: 12 slots in CT, 7 slots in LT
```

### Example 3: MASC for 55-ton Mech

**Input**:
```typescript
const mechTonnage = 55;
const techBase = TechBase.INNER_SPHERE;
```

**Processing**:
```typescript
// Calculate MASC weight
const mascWeight = mechTonnage * 0.05; // 2.75 tons
const mascSlots = Math.ceil(mascWeight); // 3 slots

const masc: ISpecialController = {
  id: 'masc-is',
  name: 'MASC',
  techBase: TechBase.INNER_SPHERE,
  rulesLevel: RulesLevel.ADVANCED,
  category: ElectronicsCategory.SPECIAL_SYSTEMS,
  functionality: 'Increases maximum running speed beyond normal limits',
  weight: mascWeight,
  criticalSlots: mascSlots,
  controlsSystem: SpecialSystemType.MASC,
  weightFormula: 'tonnage * 0.05',
  locationRestrictions: [LocationRestriction.NO_HEAD]
};
```

**Output**:
```typescript
// MASC: 2.75 tons, 3 slots
// Can be placed in CT, LT, RT, LA, RA, LL, or RL
// Mutually exclusive with Supercharger and TSM
```

### Example 4: C3 Network Setup

**Input**:
```typescript
// Master unit
const c3Master: IC3System = {
  id: 'c3-master-is',
  name: 'C3 Master Computer',
  techBase: TechBase.INNER_SPHERE,
  rulesLevel: RulesLevel.STANDARD,
  category: ElectronicsCategory.COMMAND_CONTROL,
  functionality: 'Network hub enabling shared targeting for up to 3 slave units',
  weight: 5,
  criticalSlots: 5,
  networkType: C3NetworkType.MASTER,
  maxConnections: 3,
  isMaster: true,
  locationRestrictions: [LocationRestriction.NO_HEAD]
};

// Slave unit
const c3Slave: IC3System = {
  id: 'c3-slave-is',
  name: 'C3 Slave',
  techBase: TechBase.INNER_SPHERE,
  rulesLevel: RulesLevel.STANDARD,
  category: ElectronicsCategory.COMMAND_CONTROL,
  functionality: 'Connects to C3 Master for shared targeting data',
  weight: 1,
  criticalSlots: 1,
  networkType: C3NetworkType.SLAVE,
  isMaster: false,
  locationRestrictions: [LocationRestriction.NO_HEAD]
};
```

**Processing**:
```typescript
// Validate: Cannot have both master and slave on same unit
const hasMultipleC3 = equipment.filter(e => e instanceof IC3System).length > 1;
if (hasMultipleC3) {
  throw new ValidationError('Only one C3 system allowed per unit');
}

// Network-level validation (requires multi-unit context)
// - Ensure slave units connect to a master
// - Verify master doesn't exceed 3 connections
// - Check all units in network are Inner Sphere tech base
```

**Output**:
```typescript
// Master unit: 5 tons, 5 slots for C3 Master
// Slave units (3x): 1 ton, 1 slot each for C3 Slave
// Total network: 1 master + 3 slaves = 4 unit lance
```

### Example 5: Tech Base Comparison - Active Probes

**Inner Sphere**:
```typescript
const beagle: IActiveProbe = {
  id: 'probe-beagle-is',
  name: 'Beagle Active Probe',
  techBase: TechBase.INNER_SPHERE,
  rulesLevel: RulesLevel.STANDARD,
  weight: 1.5,
  criticalSlots: 2,
  effectRange: 4, // 4 hex range
  countersECM: true,
  detectsHidden: true
};
```

**Clan**:
```typescript
const clanProbe: IActiveProbe = {
  id: 'probe-clan',
  name: 'Active Probe',
  techBase: TechBase.CLAN,
  rulesLevel: RulesLevel.STANDARD,
  weight: 1, // Lighter
  criticalSlots: 1, // Fewer slots
  effectRange: 5, // Better range
  countersECM: true,
  detectsHidden: true
};
```

**Comparison**:
- Clan: 1 ton, 1 slot, 5 hex range
- IS Beagle: 1.5 tons, 2 slots, 4 hex range
- Clan version is superior in all metrics (lighter, fewer slots, better range)
