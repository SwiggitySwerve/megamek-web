## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Heat Generation
The system SHALL track heat generated by weapons and movement.

#### Scenario: Weapon heat
- **WHEN** weapons are fired
- **THEN** heat generated SHALL equal sum of weapon heat values
- **AND** heat SHALL accumulate each turn

#### Scenario: Movement heat
- **WHEN** mech moves
- **THEN** running SHALL generate 2 heat
- **AND** jumping SHALL generate 1 heat per jump MP used

### Requirement: Heat Dissipation
The system SHALL calculate heat dissipation from heat sinks.

#### Scenario: Heat sink dissipation
- **WHEN** calculating heat dissipation
- **THEN** single heat sinks dissipate 1 heat each
- **AND** double heat sinks dissipate 2 heat each
- **AND** minimum 10 heat sinks required

### Requirement: Heat Effects
Excess heat SHALL cause negative effects.

#### Scenario: Heat scale
- **WHEN** heat exceeds dissipation
- **THEN** movement penalties SHALL apply at thresholds
- **AND** shutdown risk SHALL increase with heat level
