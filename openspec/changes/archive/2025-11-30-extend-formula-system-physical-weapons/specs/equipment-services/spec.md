- **THEN** formula type MUST be one of: FIXED, CEIL_DIVIDE, FLOOR_DIVIDE, MULTIPLY, MULTIPLY_ROUND, EQUALS_WEIGHT, EQUALS_FIELD, MIN, MAX, PLUS
- **AND** each type has specific required fields

#### Scenario: PLUS combinator
- **GIVEN** a formula with type PLUS and a base formula with a bonus value
- **WHEN** evaluating the formula
- **THEN** return the result of the base formula plus the bonus value

#### Scenario: MIN combinator
- **GIVEN** a formula with type MIN and formulas array

- **AND** evaluate weight formula: ceil(10 / 4) = 3 tons
- **AND** evaluate slots formula: EQUALS_WEIGHT = 3
- **AND** evaluate cost formula: 3 × 10000 = 30000
- **AND** return { weight: 3, criticalSlots: 3, cost: 30000 }

#### Scenario: Calculate MASC weight
- **GIVEN** a mech with engine rating 300 and 75 tons
- **WHEN** calculateProperties("masc-is", { engineRating: 300, tonnage: 75 }) is called
- **THEN** look up formulas in registry
- **AND** evaluate weight formula: ceil(300 / 20) = 15 tons
- **AND** return weight = 15, criticalSlots = 15

#### Scenario: Calculate physical weapon properties with damage
- **GIVEN** a 75-ton mech
- **WHEN** calculateProperties("hatchet", { tonnage: 75 }) is called
- **THEN** evaluate weight formula: ceil(75 / 15) = 5 tons
- **AND** evaluate slots formula: EQUALS_WEIGHT = 5
- **AND** evaluate damage formula: floor(75 / 5) = 15
- **AND** return { weight: 5, criticalSlots: 5, cost: 25000, damage: 15 }

#### Scenario: Calculate Sword damage with bonus
- **GIVEN** a 50-ton mech
- **WHEN** calculateProperties("sword", { tonnage: 50 }) is called
- **THEN** evaluate damage formula: floor(50 / 10) + 1 = 6
- **AND** return damage = 6

#### Scenario: Calculate custom equipment
- **GIVEN** custom formulas registered for "my-custom-equipment"
- **WHEN** calculateProperties("my-custom-equipment", context) is called
- **THEN** use custom formulas from registry
- **AND** return calculated properties

#### Scenario: Unknown equipment
- **GIVEN** no formulas exist for "unknown-equipment"
- **WHEN** calculateProperties("unknown-equipment", context) is called
- **THEN** throw ValidationError "Unknown variable equipment: unknown-equipment"

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Physical Weapon Formula Definitions

The system SHALL define data-driven formulas for all standard physical weapons.

**Rationale**: Physical weapons have variable weight, slots, and damage based on mech tonnage. Using the unified formula system enables custom physical weapons.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Hatchet formula
- **GIVEN** builtin formulas include "hatchet"
- **THEN** weight formula = CEIL_DIVIDE(tonnage, 15)
- **AND** slots formula = EQUALS_WEIGHT
- **AND** cost formula = MULTIPLY(weight, 5000)
- **AND** damage formula = FLOOR_DIVIDE(tonnage, 5)
- **AND** requiredContext = ["tonnage"]

#### Scenario: Sword formula
- **GIVEN** builtin formulas include "sword"
- **THEN** weight formula = CEIL_DIVIDE(tonnage, 15)
- **AND** slots formula = EQUALS_WEIGHT
- **AND** cost formula = MULTIPLY(weight, 10000)
- **AND** damage formula = PLUS(FLOOR_DIVIDE(tonnage, 10), 1)
- **AND** requiredContext = ["tonnage"]

#### Scenario: Mace formula
- **GIVEN** builtin formulas include "mace"
- **THEN** weight formula = CEIL_DIVIDE(tonnage, 10)
- **AND** slots formula = EQUALS_WEIGHT
- **AND** cost formula = MULTIPLY(weight, 7500)
- **AND** damage formula = FLOOR_DIVIDE(tonnage, 4)
- **AND** requiredContext = ["tonnage"]

#### Scenario: Claws formula (Clan)
- **GIVEN** builtin formulas include "claws"
- **THEN** weight formula = CEIL_DIVIDE(tonnage, 15)

### Requirement: Damage Formula Support

The system SHALL support optional damage calculation in variable equipment formulas.

**Rationale**: Physical weapons require damage calculation based on mech tonnage, fitting the same pattern as weight/slots/cost.

**Priority**: High

#### Scenario: Formula set with damage
- **GIVEN** a formula definition with damage field
- **WHEN** evaluating the formula set
- **THEN** calculate damage using the provided formula
- **AND** include damage in returned properties

#### Scenario: Formula set without damage
- **GIVEN** a formula definition without damage field (e.g., Targeting Computer)
- **WHEN** evaluating the formula set
- **THEN** do not include damage in returned properties
- **AND** return undefined for damage field
