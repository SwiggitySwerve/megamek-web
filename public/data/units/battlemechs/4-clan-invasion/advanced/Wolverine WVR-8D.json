    "overview": "The Wolverine commonly served as a heavy scout unit. Often deployed in situations where heavy opposition could easily destroy lighter BattleMechs, it has had a reliable service record ever since its initial deployment within the Star League Defense Force. With respectable armor, speed, and firepower, it can easily outfight lighter enemy scouts and defend itself capably if ambushed.",
    "capabilities": "The autocannon, missile system and laser found on most Wolverines are all reliable and well-storied systems. Unfortunately, the jump jets suffer from an opposing reputation; the Northrup 12000's are underpowered and prone to breakdowns. The one defining system to be found on the Wolverine, however, are its superb Tek BattleCom and Garret T11-b communications systems. The comgear, regardless of the manufacturer, is well-shielded and features a multi-channel transmitter and receiver, making the Wolverine a powerful Command BattleMech for scouting formations.",
    "history": "A widespread part of every major military, the Wolverine has manufacturing plants scattered throughout the entire Inner Sphere. While certain states-notably the Free Worlds League-have larger numbers of the design, only the Capellans began facing a shortage of the Wolverine after the loss of their Nanking facilities.",
    "deployment": "The 8D Wolverine is an one of two updated versions introduced by Kallon in 3066 that incorporates some of the newest equipment to the AFFS. The 'Mech is built with an Endo Steel chassis and uses an XL engine augmented with MASC, enabling speeds of up to 108 km/h. Its main gun is a Rotary Autocannon/2, backed up by an ER Medium Laser and a Streak SRM-6 launcher. Both the Rotary Autocannon and the ER Medium Laser are linked to an advanced Targeting Computer, making the Wolverine extremely accurate. However the design carries only ten double heat sinks.",
