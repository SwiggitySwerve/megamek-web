    "overview": "The Turkina is a powerful OmniMech that was first seen in the Turkina Keshik at the Battle of Tukayyid, and entered general service with Clan Jade Falcon following the end of the Refusal War. In a design oddity, the Turkina mounts enough jump jets to vault 90 meters hardwired onto the frame, rather than using them in modular pods. While this simplified repair, it also uses tonnage that could be devoted to other systems when a mission does not call for jumping. Designers also included fifteen double heat sinks, four more than could be fit into the engine, so they are fixed in the torso. The Turkina has 42 tons available for modular pods.",
    "capabilities": "The primary configuration is armed for long-range combat with twin ER PPCs, LRM-15s, and LB-X Autocannon/5s. Four extra double heat sinks keeps heat manageable, while enough ammunition is mounted to keep the Turkina in the fight for extended periods.",
    "history": "The Turkina is named after Turkina, the first Jade Falcon to be tamed, who inspired the leaders of Clan Jade Falcon in its early days. The name of the Turkina Keshik is also derived from this bird.\nmanufacturer:Complex Beta, Olivetti Weapons\nprimaryfactory:Ironhold, Sudeten\nsystemmanufacturer:CHASSIS:JF Standard\nsystemmanufacturer:ENGINE:285 JF Extralight\nsystemmanufacturer:ARMOR:JF Standard\nsystemmanufacturer:COMMUNICATIONS:JF Integrated\nsystemmanufacturer:TARGETING:Series JFIX/Olivetti Pinpoint Advanced"
