    "overview": "The Raijin is designed to be highly mobile and capable of engaging an enemy at a variety of ranges.",
    "capabilities": "The 'Mech's relatively light armor can be a liability if it is engaged in close combat or finds itself in a protracted engagement.",
    "history": "The Raijin was designed after the Battle of Tukayyid to rearm ComGuard units that had suffered losses in the campaign. Despite having stockpiled Star League-era BattleMechs at his disposal, Precentor Martial Focht wanted something unfamiliar to both the Inner Sphere and the Clans. The Raijin was redesigned after Word of Blake forces lost considerable amounts of the design during its taking of Terra from ComStar in 3058. Newly redesigned Raijin II units began to be deployed in 3066, with older versions of the 'Mech being refitted to RJN-200-A variant standards. While off-shoots of the 200-A were deployed to elite Divisions.",
    "deployment": "A greatly improved version of the Raijin, the C model turns the 'Mech into a powerful close range brawler. This necessitated that the 'Mech's entire arsenal be stripped and replaced, as well as the addition of one and a half tons of armor. The 'Mech's primary weapon is a Large Pulse Laser, backed up by three ER Medium Lasers, and a Streak SRM-6. Finally, the 'Mech also incorporates an improved C3 system that allows it to provide targeting data to friendly units.",
