    "overview": "The Savage Coyote OmniMech was created as a showcase OmniMech. The 'Mech was also part of Khan Koga's attempts to revitalize the fading Clan that invented the OmniMech.",
    "capabilities": "This assault 'Mech uses an XL Engine to save enough weight to devote forty-five tons of space to modular equipment and fifteen tons of armor. The base chassis contains fourteen fixed double heat sinks.",
    "history": "Following the development of Advanced Tactical Missile technology. The creation of the Savage Coyote was a direct result of both the warriors of Clan Coyote clamoring for new weapons to use and the election of Khan Sullivan Koga in 3052.",
    "deployment": "Though the first alternate configuration is focused on close-range combat, it carries an ER Large Laser and Gauss Rifle for long-range work. Three ATM 6s are effective at all ranges, while a trio of Medium Pulse Lasers aid with the devastating attack. Enough jump jets to vault up to ninety meters at a time helps MechWarriors get into close range, while an Anti-Missile System grants added defensive capability.",
