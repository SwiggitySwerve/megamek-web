    "overview": "The Tomahawk is an assault-class OmniMech designed by Clan Wolf in 3063. The 'Mech ultimately failed to enter production and remained a prototype, presumably due at least in part to the Clan's troubles during the Jihad.",
    "history": "One of these prototypes was piloted by Nathan Wolf in a Circle of Equals on Tamar when he attained the rank of Star Colonel. Although he was victorious against a Thor, it was noted that the Tomahawk still suffered from numerous system errors and gremlins and was not yet ready for mass production. Still, Nathan retained the 'Mech for his subsequent assignment to Omega Galaxy and successfully piloted it in combat on Novo Cressidas in the Star's End system on 11 April 3064. After the Jihad, the design was revisited and improved, and became the Tomahawk II which did enter line production.",
    "deployment": "Designed as a close-in fighter, this configuration features pair of hard hitting Ultra Class 20 Autocannons mounted in the arms. In this configuration, the arms can be flipped over to engage enemies in the rear arc. In this configuration the 'Mech also sports three Medium Pulse Lasers, two Streak 6 SRM Launchers and a single ER Large Laser. Ammunition for the autocannons is stored in the arms and side torsos. Three additional Double Heat Sinks are fitted in the center torso and legs.",
