    "overview": "The Night Gyr came back with Clan Jade Falcon leaders following their return to the Clan homeworlds in 3051 to elect a new ilKhan. It has become more prevalent in the Falcon touman following the Refusal War.",
    "capabilities": "No expense was spared in the manufacture of this OmniMech that uses an XL Engine and Endo Steel to save weight. It also incorporates eleven and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. Though it is on the slow end for a Clan heavy 'Mech, the Night Gyr mounts four fixed jump jets that enable it to jump up to 120 meters in a single bound. The design was a testbed for some new technologies, including the Laser Heat Sink, which was eventually phased out due to a lack of increased performance.",
    "history": "During the Wars of Reaving, Night Gyr's production facilities on Ironhold, would end up being destroyed in 3076.\nmanufacturer:Ironhold Gamma Complex",
    "deployment": "This first variant is a short-range powerhouse. It mounts an Ultra Autocannon/20 to breach opponent's armor and a pair of Streak SRM-6s to exploit those holes. A Large Pulse Laser and a trio of Medium Pulse Lasers are highly accurate weapons that can help to minimize collateral damage in an urban environment. Even with four additional double heat sinks, this variant can be quickly overwhelmed by heat.",
