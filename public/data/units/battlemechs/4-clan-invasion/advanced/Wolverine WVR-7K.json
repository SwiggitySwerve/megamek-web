    "overview": "The Wolverine commonly served as a heavy scout unit. Often deployed in situations where heavy opposition could easily destroy lighter BattleMechs, it has had a reliable service record ever since its initial deployment within the Star League Defense Force. With respectable armor, speed, and firepower, it can easily outfight lighter enemy scouts and defend itself capably if ambushed.",
    "capabilities": "The autocannon, missile system and laser found on most Wolverines are all reliable and well-storied systems. Unfortunately, the jump jets suffer from an opposing reputation; the Northrup 12000's are underpowered and prone to breakdowns. The one defining system to be found on the Wolverine, however, are its superb Tek BattleCom and Garret T11-b communications systems. The comgear, regardless of the manufacturer, is well-shielded and features a multi-channel transmitter and receiver, making the Wolverine a powerful Command BattleMech for scouting formations.",
    "history": "A widespread part of every major military, the Wolverine has manufacturing plants scattered throughout the entire Inner Sphere. While certain states-notably the Free Worlds League-have larger numbers of the design, only the Capellans began facing a shortage of the Wolverine after the loss of their Nanking facilities.",
    "deployment": "Another major upgrade of the Wolverine, this one for the Combine and first rolling off Marduk's production lines in 3050, the 7K model is also built with an XL Engine for power with the saved weight used to increase and upgrade its arsenal. The primary weapon is a Victory Drumbeat Large Pulse Laser and a Victory Throb Small Pulse Laser in the right arm, which is backed up by a medium pulse laser in the head and two Telos-6 SRM-6 launchers in the left and right torsos with one ton of reloads each. The 'Mech uses thirteen double heat sinks to dissipate the added heat from the laser arsenal. Additionally, the 7K does have jump jets and can jump up to 150 meters, and while still carrying standard armor it increases the amount by one and a half tons for added protection.",
