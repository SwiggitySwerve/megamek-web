    "overview": "The Perseus is the product of a program begun by the League Central Coordination and Command to create an OmniMech completely indigenous to the Free Worlds League from concept to production.",
    "capabilities": "While on paper the Perseus is a capable 'Mech with forty-tons of available pod space, the design has earned something of a lackluster reputation when compared to other modern OmniMechs such as the Templar or Hauptmann. This is largely due to the small size of it's weapon bays which limit the type of weaponry of the Perseus can mount, only the arms can carry larger autocannons and the hand and lower-arm actuators must be removed to be able do so, with a number of configurations also forced to mount weaponry in the 'Mech's legs. More critically the small size of the bays hampers the volume of extra double heat sinks that can be carried, consequently most of the Perseus's configurations utilize ballistic and missile weaponry over more heat-intensive energy loadouts. Built on a lightweight Endo Steel chassis, the Perseus is powered by a Hermes 300 XL engine helping save even more weight and giving the 'Mech a top speed of 64.8 km/h. The advanced structure and engine save a great deal of weight for weapons and equipment. The Perseus is protected by fourteen tons of Valiant Lamellor armor, giving it around average armor protection for a 'Mech of its size. It also has twelve double heat sinks that are fixed on the chassis.",
    "history": "The Perseus shares much with the venerable Orion, a staple of Free Worlds League Military, both broadly resembling the older design visually and using a number of the same components. This similarity prompted more than a few FWLM technicians to nickname the new design the \"Omni-Orion\" and the deployment of Perseus has largely been to front-line units that fielded large concentrations of its progenitor, replacing older Orions on a one-for-one basis.",
    "deployment": "Capable of fighting at close and long ranges, the B configuration has a Gauss Rifle and ER Large Laser for long range combat, though only a single ton of reloads relegates the Gauss to use as a secondary rather than primary weapon. The Perseus B is also capable of handling close combat with two Large Pulse Lasers and has an Anti-Missile System to protect itself from missile attacks.",
