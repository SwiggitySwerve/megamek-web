    "overview": "Born from the Terran Hegemony's attempts to create a medium fire-support platform that would be more advanced than the RLN-1N Rifleman.",
    "capabilities": "The Galahad utilizes special building materials in the form of eleven tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor and Endo Steel internals. To fit the massive weapons on the Galahad, the engine was dropped to a GM 180, giving it a maximum speed of only 54 km/h, making it difficult for the 'Mech to keep up with its companions in most cases.",
    "history": "Mitchell Vehicles unveiled the GLH-1D Galahad in 2570. Though it outgunned the earlier design and found significant acceptance within the Hegemony Armed Forces, the Galahad suffered from the same heat issues as the BattleMech it was meant to replace. With the development of the new Gauss Rifle, Mitchell Vehicles decided in 2594 to redesign the Galahad around these new weapons, changing it into a heavy design in the process. Production of the 2D Galahad continued for almost two centuries, only stopping when the Graham IV manufacturing center was destroyed during the First Succession War. While the older GLH-1D did spread to the Member State militaries, because the GLH-2D possessed so much advanced technology, the Galahad was mainly (but not exclusively) reserved for SLDF Royal Units. Most functioning GLH-2D Galahads departed the Inner Sphere during Kerensky's Exodus. Though sizable numbers of the less advanced GLH-1D remained behind, the technological decline of the Succession Wars era soon made it impossible for the Inner Sphere to maintain either variant. Outside the secret stockpiles of ComStar and patchwork examples in the Periphery or other backwaters, the Galahad was one of many designs that disappeared from the battlefield. During the Word of Blake Jihad, the Blakists put the Galahad back in production for the first time in centuries at the massive Defiance Industries plant on Hesperus II. After the factory was retaken by the Lyran Alliance and its allies, production of the 'Mech would continue for the Lyrans as of 3079.",
    "deployment": "This custom variant of the Galahad was used by Phantom Demi-Precentor Delta Laodices, a commander of the 40th Shadow Division. It uses a Small Cockpit, an Improved C3 Computer, one Light Gauss Rifle, and a Guardian ECM Suite - just like a standard 3D Galahad. It differs, however, in that it drops the other Light Gauss Rifle and one ton of ammunition, replacing them with an ER PPC enhanced by an experimental PPC Capacitor in the right arm. In addition, a Light PPC is mounted in the center torso. These modifications allow the 'Mech to remain in combat for far longer.",
