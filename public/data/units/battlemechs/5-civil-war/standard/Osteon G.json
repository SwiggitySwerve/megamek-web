    "overview": "The Osteon was The Society's assault-class OmniMech. To maximize the 'Mech's battlefield longevity, the designers focused on survivability above other considerations. Eighteen tons of Ferro-Lamellor armor provide excellent protection against weapons fire, but in case the armor is breached the Reinforced Structure will resist most attacks. In addition, the Torso-Mounted Cockpit allows the Osteon's pilot to take advantage of the heavy center torso armor. To maximize the Osteon's damage potential, a Nova CEWS allows the unit to share targeting data with friendly units. This equipment is so valuable that it's permanently mounted in the 'Mech's head.",
    "capabilities": "A fire-support variant, this configuration carries two Arrow IV missile launchers. Two ER Medium Lasers and two Medium Pulse Lasers provide close-range firepower.",
    "deployment": "Due to the role this Omnimech played with The Society during the Wars of Reaving, the Osteon, as of 3090, was outlawed by the Home Clans, although it was undergoing study.\nmanufacturer:Kerensky Memorial Manufacturing\nprimaryfactory:Strana Mechty\nsystemmanufacturer:CHASSIS:85-100T Support Reinforced Lambda Profile\nsystemmanufacturer:ENGINE:Model-G 255 XL\nsystemmanufacturer:ARMOR:Gravastar Ferro-Lamellor\nsystemmanufacturer:COMMUNICATIONS:Model 74/129.3 TCS\nsystemmanufacturer:TARGETING:S438 Mk.
