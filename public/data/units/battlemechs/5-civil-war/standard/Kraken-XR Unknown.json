    "overview": "The Bane is a BattleMech that is based upon a Star League prototype that was never put into production. Tagged the Kraken by Inner Sphere forces who opposed it.",
    "capabilities": "The Bane was first built in 2827. It was originally a significant part of many Clan toumans, but was gradually relegated to second-line status following the introduction of the OmniMech. As such, it is still critical to many defensive units. The design uses a lightweight XL Engine so that it can mount the arsenal that it does. Nineteen tons of armor protects this venerable assault 'Mech.",
    "deployment": "A Clan Jade Falcon variant that uses Experimental Technology extensively, the Kraken-XR was first spotted at Olivetti Weaponry on Sudeten. The standard Kraken skeleton was replaced by an Endo-Composite Structure to save weight while keeping strength. The Kraken-XR uses sixteen Laser Heat Sinks, and carries nineteen tons of Reflective Armor for protection. The weapons load appears to be a cross between the Bane 2 and Bane 3 variants, consisting of a pair of Rotary AC/2s in each arm and a Streak LRM-10 in each torso. A single ER Large Laser acts as a backup weapon in case the ammunition runs dry. For more protection the Kraken-XR mounts CASE II in each ammunition bay.",
