    "history": "The Ryoken II, first walked off the assembly line in 3075 during the Word of Blake Jihad. When the Ghost Bears later decided to sell some to the Republic of the Sphere, it caused a ruckus among some of the Clans, including a few Trials of Grievance from Clan Hell's Horses.\nmanufacturer:Bergan Industries\nprimaryfactory:Alshain\nsystemmanufacturer:CHASSIS:DSAM ENDO 5\nsystemmanufacturer:ENGINE:GM 375 Fusion Extralight\nsystemmanufacturer:ARMOR:Forging ZK20\nsystemmanufacturer:COMMUNICATIONS:Garret GBX-2 Amalgamated Targeting and Tracking\nsystemmanufacturer:TARGETING:Alshain B4 Series 2 T&T",
    "deployment": "This variant is better suited to close range work and was introduced during the Jihad. It trades the autocannons for a pair of Ultra Autocannon/10s and four tons of ammunition for them. Though ammo stores are still limited, this variant is more likely to succeed in greatly damaging its opponent before the stores run out. This is also more imperative, as it mounts two tons less armor."
