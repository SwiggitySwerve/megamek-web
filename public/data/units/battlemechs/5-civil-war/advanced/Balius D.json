    "overview": "The Balius is a quadrupedal, front-line OmniMech produced by Clan Hell's Horses.",
    "capabilities": "The Balius, a true frontline Omni, employs weight-saving technologies such as an Endo Steel chassis, eleven tons of ferro-fibrous armor, and an XL engine. In a quad, though, this leaves limited room for other components. The Balius, on the other hand, has a top speed of 97 km/h, which is fairly fast for a 'Mech of its size. The Balius is equipped with a Creosote Special-H Flamer that can be used against troops as well as as a psychological weapon.",
    "history": "As of 3075, few details were available about the 'Mech. It is a totem 'Mech, resembling a horse, that is meant to improve morale as much as to be an effective combat unit. There is apparently no factory producing this design. Instead, it is hand-crafted by a crew of technicians specifically selected for the task by the Khan. This has led to few Balius' being produced, so the 'Mech is only in the hands of select Bloodnamed warriors.",
    "deployment": "The final variant is a sniper. It has six jump jets, enabling the Balius D to vault up to 180 meters at a time. An ER PPC can fell foes at range, while four ER Medium Lasers can down them up close. Two Medium Pulses are again rear-firing.",
