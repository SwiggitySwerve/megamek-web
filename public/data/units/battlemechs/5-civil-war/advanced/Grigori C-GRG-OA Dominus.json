    "overview": "The Grigori is one of the Word of Blake's new Celestial series OmniMechs designed by Doctor Devon Cortland.",
    "capabilities": "It is constructed on a standard chassis, but makes use of eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, a light fusion engine, and an XL Gyro; as well as the small cockpit that is common to all of the Celestials. Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire.",
    "history": "The Grigori (named after fallen angels from Christianity) was added to the Word of Blake Militia's arsenal in late 3069 as Doctor Cortland oversaw the final production personally.",
    "deployment": "This variant uses four, torso-mounted jump jets to propel it up to one hundred twenty meters at a time. Its largest weapon is the Heavy PPC that can dish out as much damage as its Clan-tech counterpart. Up close, the Grigori Dominus uses paired ER Medium Lasers and Medium Pulse Lasers, as well as a head-mounted Streak SRM-6. A pair of extra double heat sinks keep heat levels manageable.",
