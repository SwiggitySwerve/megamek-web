    "overview": "Luthien Armor Works was working on an upgrade of the Mongoose for ComStar to be a faster and tougher scout 'Mech, when the chaos on Luthien during the early years of the Jihad forced them to look elsewhere.",
    "capabilities": "The result is the Mongoose II, an effective hunter-killer that is able to find hidden enemies and provide long range fire support. Equipped with an impressive suite of electronics, the 'Mech carries a Beagle Active Probe, Guardian ECM Suite, C3i Computer, and MASC that enables it move up to 172 km/h in bursts. A respectable seven tons of armor protects the Mongoose II.",
    "history": "ComStar financed a refit of a lost Rim Worlds Republic factory on Kwangjong-ni. New versions of the Zeus and Banshee were walking off the line for battlefield testing when Word of Blake conquered Hesperus II. Anxious to stay solvent, ComStar C-bills paid for the upgrade to the Kwangjong-ni facility. In exchange, Defiance sold them sixty-six percent of its production for its first two years.",
    "deployment": "This variant is built using a C3 Slave Unit so that it can integrate with the C3 systems in use by the Lyran Alliance. Six and a half tons of Stealth Armor use the ECM Suite to make the 267 a difficult target at range, taking advantage of the long range weapon. A Targeting Computer makes the laser even more accurate.",
