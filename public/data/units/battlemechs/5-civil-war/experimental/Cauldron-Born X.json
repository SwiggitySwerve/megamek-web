    "capabilities": "The X variant is equipped with an Angel ECM Suite for protection, and a Targeting Computer linked to the weapon systems. This configuration carries a Rotary AC/5 in the right arm, three ER Medium Pulse Lasers and a single ER Small Pulse Laser.",
    "history": "Facing it for the first time when engaging the First Jaguar Guards Cluster in the Kado-Guchi Valley, the 'Mech's ability to take damage and remain operational led the Inner Sphere warriors who fought it to call it the Cauldron-Born after the unstoppable zombies of Irish myth. Paradoxically many of the other Clans also used the Inner Sphere Cauldron-Born reporting name, having first learned detailed information of the design from Inner Sphere sources. By Operation BULLDOG the Cauldron-Born made up a large proportion of the heavy 'Mechs of the rebuilding Smoke Jaguars, and following their Annihilation the design proliferated the remaining Clans, save the Jade Falcons, Wolves and Coyotes who continued to favor the Hellbringer. Following the Wars of Reaving the Ebon Jaguar had finally supplanted the Hellbringer in most Homeworld Clans, save the Coyotes who remained loyal to redeeming the honor of the design.\nmanufacturer:Huntress Manufacturing Plant DL-6\nprimaryfactory:Huntress\nsystemmanufacturer:CHASSIS:CSJ Type 65.43 Endo\nsystemmanufacturer:ENGINE:Consolidated Fusion 325 XL\nsystemmanufacturer:ARMOR:Composite A-4 Ferro-Fibrous\nsystemmanufacturer:COMMUNICATIONS:Hector CC-22E\nsystemmanufacturer:TARGETING:Integrated Bravo-7"
