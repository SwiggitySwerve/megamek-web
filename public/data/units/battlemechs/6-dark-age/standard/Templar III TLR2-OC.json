    "overview": "The Templar III is a Dark Age era Assault Class OmniMech, first produced by General Motors for the Federated Suns. It was intended as a replacement for the original Templar, whose factory lines were destroyed during the Jihad. General Motors established a new production line on New Valencia for what was to become the next generation of the Templar with newer technologies.",
    "capabilities": "Like its predecessor, the Templar III is typically utilized as a Command 'Mech by AFFS forces. With its alternate configurations the 'Mech is able to handle various combat situations thanks to access to Advanced equipment.",
    "history": "Among the most noticeable differences when comparing the original Templar to the Templar III is its smaller Pod Capacity. The new 'Mech has a 29 ton Pod capacity in comparison to the old Templar's 40 tons. However, the 'Mech's heavier Light Engine provides improved durability while retaining the original design's maximum speed and armor protection.",
    "deployment": "The second of the Templar III's advanced tech configurations, the C Configuration is armed with the following: a single Class 5 Rotary Autocannon, a pair of ER medium lasers, a Six-Tubed Streak SRM Launcher, an ER Small Laser, and a single Large Re-Engineered Laser. The autocannon is supplied with 3 tons of ammunition, while 1 ton of ammunition is allotted to the Streak Launcher.",
