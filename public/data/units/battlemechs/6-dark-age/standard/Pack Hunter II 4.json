    "overview": "The Pack Hunter II is a light BattleMech produced by Clan Wolf-in-Exile on Arc-Royal during the Jihad.",
    "capabilities": "The 'Mech's legs are protected from possible Battle Armor attack by having a B-Pod mounted in each leg. The 'Mech's weapons and movement heat is managed by 10 Double Heat Sinks, but it's not adequate enough to handle the 'Mech's heat load.",
    "history": "The 'Mech would first appear in combat in 3077 after a considerable amount of delays in its development. The design was originally seen as the OmniMech successor to the original Pack Hunter, however the Blakist attack against Arc-Royal and other priorities caused the delays. The Pack Hunter II improves on its predecessorâs qualities. Among the things the 'Mech has been fitted with, the designers made a substantial improvement in armor and weaponry while retaining the original's speed. In a bid to improve survival rates of pilots, the design also includes a Full-Head Ejection System to prevent the loss of a warrior in combat. The design had been seen deployed by 3085 with toumans of Clan Hell's Horses, the Draconis Combine and the Republic of the Sphere",
    "deployment": "This version of the Pack Hunter was introduced during the Dark Age in 3093. The B-Pods and ER Medium Lasers have been removed, leaving it with only a single ER PPC. In place of secondary weapons, each arm and leg has been equipped with an Actuator Enhancement System.",
