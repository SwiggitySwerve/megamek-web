    "overview": "Introduced in 3049 to address flaws in the venerable Hellbringer, by Operation REVIVAL the Ebon Jaguar had only just started to spread through the Jaguar's touman with the Inner Sphere first encountering the design during the Battle of Luthien.",
    "capabilities": "Mounting an ER PPC in each arm and an ATM 6 in each side torso the Ebon Jaguar F is a fearsome variant that can tear into its foes and any range. Three tons of ATM ammo split between the side torsos, two in the right and one in the left, allow the full tactical flexibility of the launchers. A Targeting Computer resides in the right torso and makes the PPCs deadly accurate. The left torso carries one additional heat sink while each arm carries two. Eighteen total heatsinks allows the F to fire its primary armament relentlessly.",
    "history": "Facing it for the first time when engaging the First Jaguar Guards Cluster in the Kado-Guchi Valley, the 'Mech's ability to take damage and remain operational led the Inner Sphere warriors who fought it to call it the Cauldron-Born after the unstoppable zombies of Irish myth. Paradoxically many of the other Clans also used the Inner Sphere Cauldron-Born reporting name, having first learned detailed information of the design from Inner Sphere sources. By Operation BULLDOG the Cauldron-Born made up a large proportion of the heavy 'Mechs of the rebuilding Smoke Jaguars, and following their Annihilation the design proliferated the remaining Clans, save the Jade Falcons, Wolves and Coyotes who continued to favor the Hellbringer. Following the Wars of Reaving the Ebon Jaguar had finally supplanted the Hellbringer in most Homeworld Clans, save the Coyotes who remained loyal to redeeming the honor of the design.",
