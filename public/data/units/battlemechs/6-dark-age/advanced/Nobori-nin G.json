    "capabilities": "No expense has been spared in the construction of this front-line OmniMech that uses an Extra-Light Engine, Endo Steel structure, and nine tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. Five jump jets enable it to leap up to 150 meters at a time.",
    "history": "First seen within the 119th Nova Cat Striker Cluster during the Battle of Luthien, a Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery intelligence officer dubbed the OmniMech with the name of \"Nobori-nin\" (Japanese for \"Banner-bearer\") due to the single fin-like projection rising from the back of the 'Mech reminding him of the banner samurai worn on their backs in feudal Japan. Prized for its flexibility across a wide range of opponents and battlefield conditions, the Huntsman was almost exclusively a Nova Cat design during the initial Clan Invasion, but prior to the Word of Blake Jihad had entered service with Clans Diamond Shark, Cloud Cobra and Star Adder.\nmanufacturer:Irece Alpha, Avon Alpha, and Brim Ironworks, Clan Protectorate Arms\nprimaryfactory:Irece, Avon, Brim, Asellus Australis\nsystemmanufacturer:CHASSIS:Mynx Type Medium Endo Steel\nsystemmanufacturer:ENGINE:250 Consolidated XL Fusion\nsystemmanufacturer:ARMOR:Alpha Compound Ferro-Fibrous\nsystemmanufacturer:JUMPJET:Northrup Starlifters M50s Standard",
    "deployment": "This configuration carries a pair of Streak SRM-6 launchers with two tons of ammunition in a CASE II protected bay. An Active Probe and Targeting Computer are also fitted. The right arm contains a Retractable Blade while the left contains three ER Medium Pulse Lasers. A leg mounted Small Pulse Laser deals with enemy infantry threats. A pod-mounted engine Supercharger allows it to sprint at 100 km/h."
