    "capabilities": "This expensive OmniMech makes use of weight-saving technologies in the form of an Endo Steel internal structure, an XL Engine, and eight tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor. The Shadow Cat III employs more pod space than the Shadow Cat at the expense of jump jets, but keeps the Myomer Accelerated Signal Circuitry that enables it to move up to 130 km/h in bursts.",
    "history": "The Clan's scientists took a cue from Clan Jade Falcon's Thor II, and removed the Shadow Cat's fixed jump jets to free up mass that would be used mostly for pod space and an enhancement of the 'Mech's armor coverage.\nmanufacturer:Barcella Beta\nprimaryfactory:Irece\nsystemmanufacturer:CHASSIS:Type 79-45 Endo Steel\nsystemmanufacturer:ENGINE:RFUM 270 XL\nsystemmanufacturer:ARMOR:Compound H17Ferro-Fibrous with CASE\nsystemmanufacturer:JUMPJET:Model KY Boosters\nsystemmanufacturer:COMMUNICATIONS:Sipher CommCon SCU-9\nsystemmanufacturer:TARGETING:Build 4 CAT TTS",
    "deployment": "The first alternate configuration is also potent at long range, but it uses a pair of ER Large Lasers to gain that potency. It utilizes two extra double heat sinks to keep heat levels comfortable and has fitted eight Improved Jump Jets for maximum jump capabilities."
