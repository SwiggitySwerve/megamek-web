    "overview": "The Templar III is a Dark Age era Assault Class OmniMech, first produced by General Motors for the Federated Suns. It was intended as a replacement for the original Templar, whose factory lines were destroyed during the Jihad. General Motors established a new production line on New Valencia for what was to become the next generation of the Templar with newer technologies.",
    "capabilities": "Like its predecessor, the Templar III is typically utilized as a Command 'Mech by AFFS forces. With its alternate configurations the 'Mech is able to handle various combat situations thanks to access to Advanced equipment.",
    "history": "Among the most noticeable differences when comparing the original Templar to the Templar III is its smaller Pod Capacity. The new 'Mech has a 29 ton Pod capacity in comparison to the old Templar's 40 tons. However, the 'Mech's heavier Light Engine provides improved durability while retaining the original design's maximum speed and armor protection.\nmanufacturer:General Motors\nprimaryfactory:New Valencia\nsystemmanufacturer:CHASSIS:Kallon Type XX Endo Steel\nsystemmanufacturer:ENGINE:GM 340 Light\nsystemmanufacturer:ARMOR:StarGuard CIV\nsystemmanufacturer:COMMUNICATIONS:Newberg Telescan 17\nsystemmanufacturer:TARGETING:Spar 3C MegaTrak",
    "deployment": "The Prime Configuration of the Templar III is not unlike the older WHM-8D Warhammer's weapons load-out. The Configuration is armed with that older design's ER PPCs, Extended-Ranged Medium and Small Lasers, while having a single 4-Tubed Short-Range Missile Launcher instead of the 6-Tubed Launcher. All of its energy weapons are tied together with a Targeting Computer and cooled down by four additional Double Heat Sinks. The launcher ammunition is protected by the Templar III"
