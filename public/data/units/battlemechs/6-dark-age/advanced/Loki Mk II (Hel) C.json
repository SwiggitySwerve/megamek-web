    "overview": "Introduced before the Blackout, the Loki Mk II has become prevalent within the Clans, particularly the Jade Falcon and Hellâs Horses toumans. It represents an evolution in Clan warfare, balancing firepower, armor, and versatility.",
    "capabilities": "The Loki Mk II trades some of the original Lokiâs speed for an impressive forty tons of pod space and significantly increased armor. This design shift allows for a variety of configurations, each suited to different combat roles. The primary configuration is tailored for long-range engagement, while the A configuration offers a balanced mix of anti-armor and anti-personnel weaponry, suitable for operations away from supply lines. The B configuration provides heavy fire support, though its specialization comes at the cost of reduced defensive capabilities.",
    "history": "The Loki Mk II's combat history is marked by notable deployments and engagements. In July 3142, the Ninth Falcon Talon Cluster of the Jade Falcons used it in a bombardment campaign on Sargasso. The robustness of the Mk IIâs armor was proven when Star Captain Henryâs unit survived a rockslide triggered during combat with the Wolves-in-Exile. Despite losing their Long Toms, the Mk IIs played a crucial role in thwarting the recapture of the world.\nmanufacturer:Csesztreg, Sudeten\nprimaryfactory:Csesztreg Industriplex Alpha , Olivetti Weaponry\nsystemmanufacturer:CHASSIS:T-E H65 Omni\nsystemmanufacturer:ENGINE:Model SF-3 (XL)\nsystemmanufacturer:ARMOR:Compound H17 Ferro-Fibrous\nsystemmanufacturer:COMMUNICATIONS:CH2B Alpha-Com\nsystemmanufacturer:TARGETING:Version Delta-II TTS(A)",
