    "overview": "The Templar III is a Dark Age era Assault Class OmniMech, first produced by General Motors for the Federated Suns. It was intended as a replacement for the original Templar, whose factory lines were destroyed during the Jihad. General Motors established a new production line on New Valencia for what was to become the next generation of the Templar with newer technologies.",
    "capabilities": "Like its predecessor, the Templar III is typically utilized as a Command 'Mech by AFFS forces. With its alternate configurations the 'Mech is able to handle various combat situations thanks to access to Advanced equipment.",
    "history": "Among the most noticeable differences when comparing the original Templar to the Templar III is its smaller Pod Capacity. The new 'Mech has a 29 ton Pod capacity in comparison to the old Templar's 40 tons. However, the 'Mech's heavier Light Engine provides improved durability while retaining the original design's maximum speed and armor protection.",
    "deployment": "Julian Davion piloted a custom Templar III with a weapon loadout similar to the Prime configuration, but upgraded to feature a full suite of Clan-tech weaponry: an ER PPC and ER medium laser in each arm, an ER Small Laser and Streak SRM-6 in the torso, and a Targeting Computer. Thanks to the resulting weight savings, four extra double heat sinks help keep the energy-intensive arsenal firing.",
