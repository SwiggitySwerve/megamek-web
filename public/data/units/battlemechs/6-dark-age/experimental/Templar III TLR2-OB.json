    "overview": "The Templar III is a Dark Age era Assault Class OmniMech, first produced by General Motors for the Federated Suns. It was intended as a replacement for the original Templar, whose factory lines were destroyed during the Jihad. General Motors established a new production line on New Valencia for what was to become the next generation of the Templar with newer technologies.",
    "capabilities": "Like its predecessor, the Templar III is typically utilized as a Command 'Mech by AFFS forces. With its alternate configurations the 'Mech is able to handle various combat situations thanks to access to Advanced equipment.",
    "history": "Among the most noticeable differences when comparing the original Templar to the Templar III is its smaller Pod Capacity. The new 'Mech has a 29 ton Pod capacity in comparison to the old Templar's 40 tons. However, the 'Mech's heavier Light Engine provides improved durability while retaining the original design's maximum speed and armor protection.",
    "deployment": "An Advanced Tech configuration, the weapons arrangement includes a side torsoâmounted ER PPC, with six Small X-Pulse Lasers. Additionally, the B Configuration is intended for close-range combat with melee weapons, and four Jump Jets for improved mobility. Its melee weapons are a right armâmounted Hatchet, while the left arm carries a Chain Whip. To help it get to its intended target quickly, the 'Mech is fitted with a Supercharger.",
