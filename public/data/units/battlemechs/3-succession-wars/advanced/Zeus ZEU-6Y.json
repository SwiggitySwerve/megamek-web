    "overview": "The Zeus was first built by the Lyran Commonwealth in 2787, just as the First Succession War began. Built at the request of Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces commanders for a new light-assault 'Mech designed to engage the enemy at long range and perform hit-and-run attacks.",
    "capabilities": "The Zeus is fast enough to keep up with most heavy 'Mechs, and with a sturdy frame, eleven and a half tons of standard armor and a versatile weapons array, is equally capable of defeating them. Its use of reliable, low-maintenance and easily modified systems at a time when most 'Mechs were built with cutting-edge technology also proved fortuitous, allowing the Zeus to be produced long after those advanced components had become Lostech.",
    "history": "Three years before its release, the first two prototypes of the Zeus would have their first \"test run\" when they were forced to repel an attack on the Hesperus II factory by the Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery. As the enemy pushed through Lyran lines, the two 'Mechs were summoned to aid, and through sheer novelty and long-range firepower, the Kuritans were forced to pause. This enabled more reinforcements to push back DCMS forces. While these prototypes were effective in repelling the attack, they were considerably more advanced than the commercial model and armed with a PPC, which proved unpredictable and unreliable during the combat. Inadequate shielding caused wild magnetic interactions between the weapon and the Zeus' engine, which was later revealed to be the source of this behavior. To guarantee that the Zeus arrived at the front lines as soon as possible, the complex energy weapon was replaced with a basic autocannon. The 'Mech initially appeared in substantial numbers after the 15th Lyran Guards regained the planet Sakhalin, and the Zeus had a long and storied history within the Commonwealth during the Succession Wars, becoming a well-respected assault 'Mech. Engineers were able to put a PPC on the Zeus again after the end of the Third Succession War, with the resulting ZEU-6T variant being the standard during the Fourth Succession War and later the War of 3039. The design was also well received by mercenary units, particularly the Zeta Battalion of Wolf's Dragoons.",
    "deployment": "Prototyped in 2922 as an experiment in logistical support, the 6Y kept the AC/5 in the right arm, but replaced the LRM-15 with a single LRM-10 launcher and a single Binary Laser Cannon was installed in place of the large laser. The missile downgrade was an attempt to alleviate the one problem in the Zeus' otherwise headache-free design, and indeed field refits had shown that the ten-tube launchers were easily adaptable. The addition of the little-loved binary cannon was a combination of two factors: fears that the slow-to-produce Thunderbolt laser was becoming Lostech and an attempt to give the Zeus a long-ranged and powerful energy weapon minus the side effects caused by its original PPC weapon. Unfortunately the heat produced from this weapon caused catastrophic failures in the surrounding myomer bundles. Engineers attempted to redesign the left torso to better dissipate heat, and eventually resorted to placing the cannon on an over-shoulder mount in the right torso, but in the end they couldn't solve the problem. Defiance went on to produce this variant in limited numbers before abandoning the project.",
