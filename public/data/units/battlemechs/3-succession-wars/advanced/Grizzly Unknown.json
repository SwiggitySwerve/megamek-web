    "overview": "The Grizzly is a multi-role heavy 'Mech with design elements shared with Clan Ghost Bear's two most common Omnis, the Vulture and the Gladiator. Because it lacks a specific combat emphasis, it has been plagued with the \"jack of all trades, master of none\" stigma and has never truly found a role in the Ghost Bear troops.",
    "capabilities": "Despite problems in its designâits layers of sloped armor tend to lodge in place when destroyed, causing havoc with joints and even weapon portsâit is still used by several garrison troops. The Grizzly can jump and has a variety of weaponry that cover a wide spectrum of fighting ranges.",
    "history": "Because it lacks a specific combat emphasis, it has been plagued with the \"jack of all trades, master of none\" stigma and has never truly found a role in the Ghost Bear troops.Â With reports of atrocities in the Rasalhague Republic during the current Jihad, the Bear Touman has began to reconsider this out-of-production design for immediate production in order to fast augment material for their anticipated entry into conflict. The Grizzly's production ended in 3013, yet there are still a big number of the design distributed around the Ghost Bear Touman. After the Combine War in 3063 revealed that the Combine was using combat armor personnel more successfully, a recent redesign of the Grizzly was tested. In tandem with the Golem battle armor project, the Technician and Scientist Caste set out to create a 'Mech design to compliment the urban-style defensive armor. Most deployed Grizzlys are being recalled to be reconfigured as a newer, more lethal urban defence variant.\nmanufacturer:Arcadia BattleMech Plant CM-T02\nprimaryfactory:Arcadia\nsystemmanufacturer:CHASSIS:Type 56-45C Modified Endo Steel\nsystemmanufacturer:ARMOR:Arcadia Compound Delta VII Standard\nsystemmanufacturer:JUMPJET:Clan Standard 14X Series\nsystemmanufacturer:COMMUNICATIONS:Garret T10B\nsystemmanufacturer:TARGETING:Series VI KITT",
    "deployment": "The Grizzly actually packs a solid long-range punch with an Omega 12-coil Gauss rifle and a Type X \"Short Bow\" LRM-10 Launcher. At closer ranges, a brace of pulse lasers provides accurate fire in the form of a Kolibri Delta Series Large Pulse Laser, Kolibri Delta Series Medium Pulse Laser, and a Chi Series Small Pulse Laser."
